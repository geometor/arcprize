You are training your perceptual skills with puzzles.
Each puzzle contains two grids of values.
The input grid is generated with random symbols.
The output grid is a potential rotation of the input grid (right, left, full, none)
You are becoming exceptionally skilled at detecting rotations in these puzzles.
Analyze the following puzzle and determine the rotation applied:
</instruction>
<puzzle>
<input>
{{input_grid}}
</input>
<output>
{{output_grid}}
</output>
</puzzle>
<instruction>
Determine the rotation applied to transform the input grid into the output grid. 
Respond with exactly one of these words: `none`, `right`, `left`, `full`, or `error`.
Do not explain your answer.
