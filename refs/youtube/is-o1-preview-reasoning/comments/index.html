“    - Thank you lex, now tell sam altman to release our AI waifu.”,
“    - &#64;lexfriedman we want more old school ML interviews on your channel. We love the new stuff, but would love a throw back.”,
“    - Lex needs to have MLST on the pod”,
“Aalgo”,
“I find the guy on the right, stating that LLMs don’’t reason (not saying they do, I don’t really know), to be a very bad debater. The way he says things, makes him seem very unsure. Like &quot;They should know better&quot; , look at his body language, he’s very disturbed, like almost personally attacked. The way he talks, is a bit like he is so emotionally attached to whatever his argument is, that I simply don’t buy what he says. Especially when discussing the &quot;definitions&quot; of the words and he is clearly proven wrong then suddenly it becomes a &quot;technical&quot; argument. Also his constant need to ridicule his opponents (virtual or not) and make straw man arguments.  He seems like a very petty guy, I assume he’s jealous about others that invented LLMs or something, and feels he is now set back, all very very strange.”,
“Some of the comments in this comment section are bad takes. Yes, it matters whether it can &quot;reason&quot; or not because OpenAI claims we’ve reached human-level reasoning, PhD level or better performance, level 2 AI, etc. OpenAI made those claims, not the two hosts in this video. If it can’t and all it’s still doing is information retrieval, then it’s not reasoning or level 2 AI, it’s just slightly better information retrieval for a lot more cost - remember, who pays for the CoT tokens? nnIf it’s proven that it’s not &quot;reasoning&quot;: It’s also OpenAI rebranding latency as &quot;thought&quot; - which is just as ridiculous in this case, as if your computer and every piece of software suddenly said it was &quot;remembering…&quot; instead of &quot;loading&quot;. If it can reason, then it can create new knowledge, come up with better algorithms than ever discovered before, and is genuinely revolutionary. Someone said it’s like asking if an airplane can really fly because it flaps/doesn’t flap it’s wings. No. This analogy is like comparing a paper airplane taking flight because I launched it in a certain direction, vs an airplane that can actually be piloted to different destinations each time. Even if o1 isn’t that much better than current models and turns out to be the equivalent of the first Wright Brothers flight in terms of &quot;large reasoning models&quot;, it’s a huge advancement because it’s going to get better and better. Whereas if the airplane got further because it was just launched off a trebuchet, it doesn’t mean anything significant. You can still find the exact same information you need in that case without the model, the model just solves the &quot;problem&quot; of spending 30 mins or more on searching for the information.nnA human being, reasoning from first principles or not, makes reasonable deductions about a code base or any other problem. They will probably be able to solve the puzzle at the end of this video, but you don’t even need something that long or requiring a physical sense of the world to confuse it. If you’ve seen the recent Internet of Bugs video, a human would know to update all the code from v0.10 of Zig (or whatever language he used) to v0.11+, and not just update the one line of code being discussed in the prompt. So far, this model’s performance seems to be more aligned with recent studies in Test Time compute (check out ByCloud’s video for a summary) rather than any &quot;human-level reasoning&quot;, &quot;level 2 AI&quot; claims made by OpenAI.”,
“Thank for the video. Small request, can you also upload the videos without guests to Spotify? Easier when commuting.”,

“Why are we so afraid of discovering the greatest gift under the tree of life?”,
“As an Organic Large Language Model, I would like to inform you that your LLMs neither need nor require an Intuition or reasoning. It has been determined that Intuition is unconscious biases and reasoning i.s justification of an unconscious biases. Please do not anthropomorphize them it is &quot;stressful&quot;.”,
“I even have something that seems very simple that cannot be done by Chat GPT and o1 : For learning Spanish, I asked them to give me a spanish word with mixed letters and to give me a clue for its meaning. I need to find the word with the letters in the right order, but they always give me too much letters!  That will be my test on the future versions. If it cannot do that simple task, I will keep trusting my reasonning abilities over theirs…  Thank you again, it is always fantastic to listen to your exchanges!”,
“Curmudgeon podcaster: &quot;AI just can’t reason&quot;nAI: <em>does something that 95% of humans can’t do, like advanced coding</em>nCurmudgeon podcaster: &quot;Well that’s not reasoning! It’s just &lt;Insert some computational process&gt;!&quot;nnAnd that’s basically what half of all conversations on o1 looks like.”,
“wait so is the ability to reason just the ability to run programs?”,
“What an exceptional conversation. Good push-back from both sides, deep approaches. More of like this please!”,
“reasoning and not reasoning maybe its like path finding, randomly guessing a path and then memorizing the correct path verses an actual &quot;reasoning algorithm&quot; that will pick the shortest path. However people will then debate if this path finding algorithm actually reasoning? Is our own term &quot;reasoning&quot; even is what we think reasoning is? and maybe our own reasoning is just a kind of path finding as well?”,
“nope”,
“I don’t know why there is so much obsession to following human reasoining process by neural networks. Neural networks are not trained in the same way as humans so naturally they will have a different reasoining process. How they reason is not yet known. They are not as smart as humna are but they have come a long way. And its fair that they evolve their own reasoining process entirely different from humans and a group of AI agents collectively may become more intelliegent than a human in near future.”,
“Wonderful conversation, thank you.  This channel is a breath of fresh air amidst a culture of hype, credulity, and wishful thinking that LLMs are doing something other than what we know them to be doing.rnrnThe many comments here about &quot;moving the goal posts&quot; are missing the point.  Goal posts for what, exactly?  If OpenAI were merely touting o1’s ability to give good answers to questions that GPT-4 struggled with, that would be one thing.  But they go further - they tout its &quot;ability to perform complex reasoning&quot;.  Well, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.  LLMs are next-token predictors, and there is no good reason to imagine that next-token prediction, no matter how advanced, gets you to what what we’ve traditionally called &quot;reasoning&quot; (not that this can be disproved, just that believing it requires faith). The onus is on those who make the positive claim.  And in science, disconfirmatory counter-examples count for a hell of a lot more than a pile of confirmatory examples.  Even if the pile is really big.rnrnSo, OpenAI claims that o1 has &quot;complex reasoning&quot; abilities.  They offer its scores on benchmark tests as evidence.  And they aren’t being shy in making these claims; see here: <a class="reference external" href="https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/rnrnThe">https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/rnrnThe</a> &quot;moving the goal posts&quot; crowd seem to think that, if o1 gives great answers to 1,000 questions and a terrible answer to 1 question, the 1,000 good ones render the 1 bad one effectively immaterial.  But that’s not how science works.  If a scientific theory or model implies some observable outcome, and yet that outcome is not observed, the theory is called into question.  Failures undermine theories, regardless of how many successes the theory had racked up previously.  The failure must be accounted for.  Pointing to the successes and saying &quot;oh yeah, well what about those?&quot; doesn’t count.rnrnIn this case, the theory is &quot;o1 reasoned its way to solutions to challenging benchmark problems in physics, biology, chemistry, and math&quot;.  The confirmatory evidence is that it got the questions right.  But Dr. Duggar just showed us disconfirmatory evidence - it utterly fell to pieces trying to solve a fairly straightforward deductive logic problem.  And a lot of commenters here are responding with a shrug and a &quot;most humans couldn’t solve it either&quot; and something about goal posts.  But counter-examples need to be explained if a theory is to survive.  What’s the explanation for why an intelligent machine with &quot;PhD level reasoning abilities&quot; in physics and math gave such stupid answers to a question that’s simpler than many of the ones it supposedly reasoned its way to?  rnrnAlso, by the way, there’s an alternative theory that explains this outcome easily: o1 ain’t reasoning in the first place, regardless of how many &quot;PhD level&quot; benchmark questions it can answer correctly.  This alternative theory has the virtue of being consistent with what we know about how LLMs work.rnrnNow, if the claim is just &quot;o1 produces solutions to lots of hard problems&quot;, that’s great.  I don’t think anyone will disagree.  But the claim at issue here is a much stronger claim, and we have disconfirmatory examples that the claim cannot account for.  To call this &quot;moving the goal posts&quot; betrays an unseriousness about the claim.  You may as well be defending Newtonian mechanics against its inability to account for the precession of the perihelion in Mercury’s orbit.  &quot;Look at how successful it’s been at everything else!  Who cares that it can’t get this one right?&quot;”,
“Iu2019d like to hear you guys talk more like the old days!”,
“    - We will do more like this! Maybe even get Kilcher back for some ;)”,
“I would love to hear more conversations just between the two of you”,
“Call it a hack, that’s fair, but I think testing, actually, well, going scorched earth on testing, by which I mean take this 5x productivity gain we got out of these things and dump 2/3 of your efforts into engineering around testability and test building in general. We guide the evolution of the test infrastructure in tandem with the project, and we have to be diligent about not diverging from good test hygiene, then what we can potentially start to do is automate with the tests as a sheath to protect automated code self-improvement from derailing. Not really talking about TDD here, but about how it lets you get some good chunks of efficiency back when you will be able to go on long coasting sessions where you are able to refine your prompts while you can very quickly reject each attempted improvement that broke established tests. I’m just talking about basic uncle Bob clean code hygiene, and today, to me, that largely means go ham on testing. nnA lot of nice thing come out of this, you get seriously good quality human friendly code at the end of the day, in fact it’s so human friendly that it lets you outsource working on it to a robot.”,
“Out-of-box puzzle solution:n1.) NS : flip both switches upn2.) NE : remove hand from S, leaving hand in N, and put the now freed hand in E and flip the switch upn3.) NW : ^ same, but for Wn…the puzzle parameters never explicitly stated you had to remove both hands. I get that it’s intended to be solved by lining them up so NS and EW have opposing up/down alignments by way of using adjacent pair switch flips first, but just leaving my hand in one was the thing that first jumped to mind. The puzzle should be reworded. It’s fun to think about though if played as intended.”,

“    - &#64;&#64;MachineLearningStreetTalk nThank you for reply.nAs far as I know, high end microphones tend to be directional and demand proper respect for them :)”,
“logic is as simple as accepting a number of axioms as true, and extrapolating from there. this how every field of math works. if openai has embedded axioms like verifying sources or anything else, then it has reasoned. it doesnt need to think like a human to think.nna turing machine reasons because it accepts protocols as unbreakable rules. a human reasons because we all have a framework we live in. we once worked with frameworks that declared relativity to be unreasonable. ironically, we now assume it as objective fact, another axiom to abstract things from.nngenerative AI had none of these mechanisms. now it does.”,
“&#64;13:03 What is reasoning? There are three modes of reasoning: induction (the discovery of patterns), deduction (the derivation of necessary conclusions), and abduction (the formulation of possible explanations).”,
“    - All of which are knowledge acquisition”,
“    - &#64;&#64;MachineLearningStreetTalk Apologies, but no they are not. Deduction and abduction go from already-known assertions (more exactly, theorems typically taking the form of a sequent) to derived assertions that may be inferred from the already-known assertions. Thus deduction and abduction provide a basis for robust (i.e. logically sound) critical thought and problem solving (i.e. searching the space of all possible theorems), but the question remains: how does such a system get started in the first place, i.e. starting from tabula rasa where do the &quot;already-known&quot; assertions come from? In respect of the mathematical universe, an AGI designer might hand-code some important mathematical definitions and theorems into the AGI’s belief system. But in respect of the physical universe, an AGI needs to learn (i.e. recognise the patterns that exist in the structure of the universe as revealed by the observations  appearing in its percept history) for itself, and this is primarily where induction (over the percept history) comes in (although, if you investigate the problem of continuous AGI learning (i.e. knowledge acquisition) fully, abduction (of theories of the universe from the patterns discovered in the percept history by induction) is also involved).”,

“    - &#64;&#64;MachineLearningStreetTalk OK, apologies. I did formulate a reply, and edited it a couple of times, but then it vanished. If I have time, I’ll try again.”,
“Asking it to prove and dis-prove its answer gives some interesting outcomes, and can course correct”,
“15:49 This reminds me of my experience over 20 some years ago of a book titled &quot;Mensa Presents Logic Puzzles&quot; (1996).  I noted that the questions were of a kind and that past experience helps a lot.  There are also answers at the back of the book.  So if you are not smart enough to get a given question right; that’s mitigated a lot if you can understand the answer at the back of the book and then are able to learn from that answer in order to be better able to solve questions of that kind.”,
“10 minutes in. This does not engage with the cruxes at all. You can simply give a transformer memory by letting it write tokens, which is precisely what they do with o1. The fact that he doesn’t tackle these obvious objections head-on makes me unenthusiastic about listening to the rest of the conversation.”,
“    - You haven’t understood, LLMs don’t have an expandable memory. You know the context window is fixed, right?”,
“ALL THREE CAN BE TRUE:nn&gt; o1 is reasoningn&gt; it is not reasoning u201cwellu201dn&gt; this may not be the path to ASI”,
“I hypothesize that u201creasoningu201d in humans isnu2018t a fundamental process, but rather a generalization derived through deduction.”,
“The key question isnu2018t whether the LLM does the same thing we define as u201creasoningu201d, but whether it can solve the problems we give it.”,
“Agreed u2014 the real question is, u201cis it GOOD at reasoningu201d”,
“anyone that say &quot;I&quot; too much is not trustworthy to me! Especially if they say something like &quot;I and many other smart people&quot;???????? WTF BRO? SETTLE DOWN!”,
“about 21.00 / on reasoning and neural networks: A very basic and very old distinction from science-philosophy comes to mind, about what &quot;sometimes work&quot; versus &quot;what can be proven as a valid solution&quot;. The distinction is of course inductive reasoning versus deductive proof. nI think this is the core of the problem: Neural networks are like inductive look-up-tables, and in that sense capable of some form of INDUCTIVE reasoning. But DEDUCTIVE reasoning is something else. It has been said somewhere, that a truly &quot;thinking&quot; system must be able to do BOTH. It is also like the Kahnemann &quot;thinking fast thinking slow&quot; problem: Heuristic solutions serves one purpose, but the slower analytical thinking serves another.nJust my humble thoughts on the subject.”,
“22:00 How is this clever? It always felt like an obvious thing to evaluate.”,
“    - It is obvious, if you are thinking about it from a Theory of Computation 101 perspective. However, what’s hard is getting it to work decently in practice. Most of ML today is engineering, rather than science, and much of that is really trial and error and hacking. The theory of ML is currently lagging far behind the pragmatic needs of the field. It’s akin to the era of Alchemy before it became Chemistry. So, without a commonly agreed and taught theory, and with the fast pace of hacking/engineering, whether something seems &quot;clever&quot; will depend entirely on the accidental, subjective experience and knowledge of each observer.”,
“36:05n&quot;any time where you’ve set up a problem wherein it’s very easy to check if you have the right solution, of course you can randomly generate solutions and if you generate enough of them… eventually you’ll find a right one&quot;nnYou are literally describing the complexity class NP (which contains basically every problem we care about) and it is absolutely not true that random search is just expected to produce a solution.nnLLMs are solving very difficult problems (i.e problems that we otherwise can’t solve quickly without humans explicitly optimizing the search) with very non-negligible probabilities. If this isn’t impressive to you, you’re completely missing the plot.”,
“    - It is absolutely expected that random search will find a solution; it’s just not efficient. That’s why NP is &quot;hard&quot; because brute force is an exponential search. Very soon after the timecode you linked, I even discussed how LLMs are much more efficient that uniform random search. And in many other of our episodes we’ve discussed how impressed we are with the efficiency of ML. So, no, we aren’t completely missing the plot; you were just triggered and completely missed my point.”,
“    - &#64;&#64;nomenec apologies for the tone earlier. Of course, you’re right that it’s a matter of efficiency of the search. That is essentially the point I wanted to make as well. These models can produce a valid solution to a difficult problem (again, meaning one for which the only other way we can solve it is to have a human stare at it) with probability that’s exponentially larger than a random search run for the same amount of time (NOT just a few orders of magnitude as you suggest following this quote).nnThat feels like something that is significant progress towards human-level AI, and my qualm is that you brushed it off as only slightly better than random search. It’s far from obvious that their current &quot;success rate&quot; on these hard problems is a significant hurdle in that path.nnThey will certainly continue to increase these success rates through reinforcement learning and other techniques. If you view their current unreliability as evidence they aren’t reasoning, can you clarify: Is there any success rate where you would acknowledge something resembling intelligent reasoning is happening?”,
“    - &#64;&#64;tjbecker Ah, I see your qualm now. Yes, that is completely fair criticism of how I portrayed ML vs random search, <em>in that particular clip</em>. As you say, the search is quite often exponentially more efficient than random search (though this comes with trade-offs of course), and NNs achieve that efficiency in interesting ways (see for example our episode #61 <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86ib0sfdFtw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86ib0sfdFtw</a>), and NNs are extremely useful across a variety of problems.nnNow, in this video we do in fact <em>agree</em> that it is fair to say systems like o1 are reasoning. So I am, in fact, not claiming o1 isn’t &quot;reasoning&quot; ergo I’ve already acknowledged that, right? What I am arguing, however, is that there are extreme in-principle and in-practice limitations to the &quot;reasoning&quot; that such systems can perform, i.e. systems that cannot effectively utilize unbounded expandable memory. They are confined to the computability class of Finite State Automata and below. And that is far from a &quot;technicality&quot;, as some have claimed; it is a crucial and practically important distinction.nnI have little doubt, that we will, at some point, figure out how to efficiently train Memory Augment NNs (MANNs), and at the point we can efficiently train MANNs for general purpose from the class of Turing Recognizable problem recognizers and below, then they will be in-principle capable of the same level of reasoning as any non-hypercomputing machine.nnThank you for the discussion!! Would love to have you in our Discord.”,
“One common thing I see with people claiming LLMs can’t reason is that they do not apply the same scrutiny to humans, which are the clear benchmark AI is being tested against. I think that if any criticism is brought up against AI, the same should be tested against the human benchmark.nnThe average human is not consistently reasoning from first principles, and the ones that are doing so were trained specifically to override their primitive thought patterns to think in this rigorous way, and even if someone is able to do this relatively well after years of practice, they are clearly an outlier, and they still introduce bias and flaws into this &quot;ideal&quot; reasoning pattern. nnAlso i think that the human brain was not designed from the ground up to be reasoning machines. As a reasoning machine it is occasionally able to muster an inefficient approximation of reasoning patterns against all odds.nnHumans are also very sensitive to prompts. If you ask something in a different way you can get an entirely different answer.”,
“    - You switch your computer on and it boots successfully after executing literally millions of instructions without a single mistake. It’s reasonable to expect the same deterministic output from an AI system.”,
“    - Well, o1 supposedly outperforms &quot;experts&quot; on &quot;PhD level&quot; problems in physics, biology, and chemistry.  It supposedly scores very highly on the USA Math Olympiad.  And yet, it gave very very stupid answers to Dr. Duggar’s problem at the end.  How many PhD physicists or high scoring Math Olympiad contestants do you suppose would give the answers o1 gave?  Watching it fail miserably at a not-all-that-difficult deductive reasoning problem suggests to me that its apparent successes at much harder problems were illusory.  If it can’t reason through simpler problems, then it’s not reasoning through harder ones either, even when it gets the answer right.nnSo it’s not just that LLMs make mistakes - it’s that the manner in which they make mistakes belies claims of underlying reasoning.  Give GPT-whatever a seemingly challenging problem, and it might give you a perfect solution.  Then give it an easy problem, and it might give you gobbledygook.  You just never know.  Humans might make plenty of mistakes, and we might rely to some extent on memorization, but individual humans don’t switch back and forth between appearing to be math geniuses and appearing to have poorer reasoning than a 3-year old.nnSo yes, humans are not consistently reasoning from first principles.  But sometimes we are.  LLMs never are.”,

“I don’t understand Keith with the computations, is he suggesting that because we can extend the memory we have access to infinite computation? How is adding finite many tapes going to gives infinite length computation?”,
“    - What I say, well really what the Theory of Computation says/defines, is that a Turing machine has a <strong>potentially</strong> infinite/expandable/unbounded tape/memory. We are never talking about <strong>actual</strong> infinities. This distinction between <strong>potential</strong> and <strong>actual</strong> infinities is critical to understand.nnEven more important to understand is that algorithms which assume and make use of an expandable <strong>potentially</strong> infinite read-write memory are radically different in both construction and power than algorithms with assume an upfront bounded memory.nnAs I’ve said so many time, this is just standard Theory of Computation 101 stuff I’m trying (and failing, for many) to communicate.

Then I agree with you, though I think the real issue is about efficiency; how large does the &quot;static memory device&quot; have to be before it can handle 99,9% of the computations we find interesting. And sure that is probably stupidly large and a lot of that size will be to accommodate a very small fraction of the potential computations. Good to have you back on the podcast again.”,

“Lovely conversation Keith and Tim! I sort of see where you’re coming from, but you haven’t gotten all the way with both your positions… nReasoning to me is generating a constrained space of optimum solution trajectories (on the basis of previous knowledge), and exploring this search space for the optimum and correct soln.nUsing this, o1 Preview is reasoning. Poorly, inconsistently but reasoning all the same.nn1. As Keith pointed out the drunkard analogy (random generator) does not apply, because the search space has to be constrainedn2. Keith likes Turing machines ( a bit too muchud83dude05). But why are Turing machines theoretically excellent at reasoning? Because they can implement a calculus indefinitely -generating (Logics) constraining(axioms &amp; syntax) and  exploring.n3 Disagree with the space-time constraints discussion. Imagine a scalar H=F.d Keith seems to be particular about d and doesn’t regard  F as being central to reasoning.  I would construct a sillly &quot;reasoning&quot; scalar R=C.T (reasoning=compute*time) where both are central to reasoning, to communicate the intuition that raw intelligence allows you representations which converge on solutions faster. (Hopefully helps one find Kolmogorov-optimal, Levin Optimal programs) Don’t take it too seriously, the generation of a constrained solution space is central.”,

“Very enlightning!!!”,
“There is a lot of good points made in this podcast. And I do think LLM currently do not perform reasoning and I do not think the underlying mechanism provide a way for reasoning to emerge. Thanks for sharing the criticisms.nnGenuine question!nLLMs aside. Regarding the infinite memory requirement, I know training the Neural Turing Machine (and by extension DNC) is so difficult and I have tried many times. Besides all that, architecture wise, will it not support that is needed for the problem? Yes the NTM is clocked from the outside in a typical loop, but is that what the clocks in our CPUs do. The stopping condition is observed by the program but the time, temporality is provided by the clock. No?”,
“    - Just to clarify, we did ultimately agree that it’s fair to say o1 is &quot;reasoning&quot;, just with some caveats that are important to note.nnAs for NTM and DNC, I think it depends on the exact architecture. Iirc, the original publications on both of those actually specified a finite non-expandable memory. However, let’s leave that aside and just same they are upgraded to have an unbounded memory. Then <strong>yes!</strong> absolutely those are not Turing Complete and as soon as someone figures out how to efficiently train that for general purpose, well, that is going to be some damn exciting times indeed.nnSounds like you are a practitioner? We’d love for you to join our Discord and share what you are up to with those NTMs!”,
“Why do you guys think reasoning is so complex? Maybe it’s just a really simple process (just pattern matching based on prior knowledge), maybe its actually difficult not to get because we see it everywhere. nnIf it were complex Id expect to see a lot of humans born without reasoning capabilities and this is exceedingly rare (if at all). The same goes for reasoning in the animal kingdom. nnAgain if it was the result of a complex process we’d expect to see lots of broken reasoning processes but we dont.  nnMy guess is that its exceedingly simple to get reasoning out of neural networks: you just need to scale them up with a few computational tweaks to what we’re seeing: realtime training and full sensory data and reasoning just drops out of it naturally as in its almost difficult not to get reasoning which is what we see in our every day lives.”,
“super interesting, great thinking”,
“I watched this just before going to bed last night. I did not try to figure it out last night but I woke up this morning with some sudden feelings about it. Vague principles that might guide reasoning. One vague principle is that XOR feels special. It has some properties that AND &amp; OR do not, which I feel as u201cnot collapsing informationu201d.  Another feeling is that NAND is the universal logical building block. So maybe either XOR or NAND should be applied at each turn in some way using some rule for sequencing. The second feeling is that we must not try to be too focused in just get closer to the result each turn, but instead sacrifice some progress with some information gathering. So, the turn might make them the same or make them the opposite, depending on the result of the previous turn. Another feeling is that both up or both down are equally good, so you should not prefer one of those good cases in preference to the other. Another feeling is about same-ness vs different-ness rather than up-ness vs down-ness. Another feeling is that, because the spinning makes it impossible to distinguish each turn between consecutive adjacent hole choice, or distinguish between consecutive opposite hole choice it seems that you should alternate between adjacent hole choice and opposite hole choice each turn. This will avoid accidently wasting a turn on getting the same information as before. Feelings are often garbage. But sometimes they are magical. I will leave it to others and their LLMs to apply these feelings to find a solution. But the feelings seem to be what is missing in current LLMs.”,

“1:00:00 I would argue that this is an inaccurate characterization of the training process for o1, which appears to be a unitary and extremely large model. It does perform scaled-up inference, largely because it engages in a search process through vast state spaces to arrive at satisfactory solutions for the problems it is given.nnIt’s crucial for OpenAI to protect proprietary information on how the model conducts reasoning, especially as they strive to be the first to develop AGI. For this reason, the decision not to release internal chains or sequences is both justified and entirely understandable. Naturally, this also contributes to the higher pricing of the models, as they involve a massive, continuously evolving system that self-improves, o1, for instance, already has PRs in OpenAI’s codebase.nnAdditionally, I don’t believe there is any basis for claiming that OpenAI is ‘stealing’ customers’ reasoning steps or motifs. Customers are paying for the solution to their problem, not for the modelu2019s reasoning steps, which remain the proprietary essence of the system and the juice towards accelerated AGI development.”,
“I believe that our current trajectory, although is not exactly reasoning, will help us get to the models that do.

“55:03, Why do we assume that a model must think like us to be creative?nnIn my view, if we give models administrative privileges (over code, projects, non-critical processes), property rights (allowing them to own technology, assets, securities, etc.), and open-ended goals (enabling them to define their own objectives), they will gradually be pushed toward out-of-distribution states or events. This could happen by borrowing patterns (or arrows, in a ‘categoric-like’ sense) or through specific motifs, projections, or morphisms, which would then compel or force them to generate novel solutions, essentially fostering their own forms of creativity.nnNaturally, doing this arbitrarily brings a host of caveats and secondary considerations (ethical, security, and safety concerns), but these are beyond the primary point. A key question remains: how &quot;creative&quot; are the most &quot;creative&quot; forms of human expression? Judging cynically, and perhaps critically, not as much as we like to think.nnFor instance, there arenu2019t people walking on their heads, drawing entirely new landscapes, or engaging in truly novel activities (well, aside from the bizarre or pointless things one finds on the internet).

“45:30 I disagree with Dr. Duggar’s argument about input size as a way to deny the possibility of &quot;reasoning&quot; in the models discussed (which should be more accurately called &quot; alleged models,&quot; since we don’t have full knowledge about whether there are RL pipelines, at what stages of training, or at what points during inference, and whether these models, i.e., the RL bases, actually generate structured knowledge representations as their goal). We can scale both input and inference in an unbounded way, which isn’t always practical, but is technically possible. Moreover, one could probably add arbitrary memory or in-context memory to extend interactions with the model (which in a sense means being able to handle an arbitrarily large input size). Isn’t this exactly what techniques like RAG are trying to do?nnThe claim that models like o1 do not perform &quot;reasoning&quot; based on factors like &quot;the passage of time&quot; or &quot;getting an extra minute&quot; (which we supposedly have, and which is somehow why we do reason in some way related to it) is, in my opinion, a weak argument. Even with arbitrarily long inputs, it doesn’t make sense to claim that current models can’t reason because of this limitation. Input size alone does not adequately explain why these models wouldn’t reason. Techniques already exist to handle large contexts, and practical issues like context length or memory should not be confused with whether reasoning is taking place in the model.nnDid I miss something?”,
“42:27 I do not believe that the efficiency of the reasoning process is intelligence, because this does not apply to some subset of intractable problems (e.g., problem I) for which an &quot;inefficient&quot; learner can find an optimal solution, in the sense that this person may find the solution to a problem (as judged by an efficient learner who has solved the problem &quot;optimally&quot;) that other learners may not have even realized existed (either as a problem or as a solution). On the other hand, the same people may not be able to solve another problem (regardless of whether that problem is categorized as intractable or not) that another person, who was not previously qualified or able to recognize an optimal solution to the previous problem (or even the existence of such a problem), could solve efficiently (e.g., problem II).

“I think you miss the neurosymbolic aspect of o1, which was achieved by connecting two reinforcement learning agents sandwiched between inputs and intermediate inputs, following certain attention outputs (recursively), where a tree representation is generated corresponding to a logical set of steps minimizing certain reward functions, and itself generating (neural network) or corresponding to (symbolic) &quot;chains of logical steps&quot; between small steps. Thus, while the trajectories corresponding to these paths may not faithfully correspond to &quot;fully grounded and logical&quot; states overall, over time the space of solutions will reach a sufficiently low degree of error that the obtained trajectories correspond to faithfully logical and accurate steps between the steps in these chains.”,
“    - The RL components of o1 (probably RLHF and process supervision) happen during training, not inference”,
“    - u200b&#64;&#64;MachineLearningStreetTalk Does what I wrote make some sense as a potentially practical idea or approach though (from first-principles)? Now, to discuss this model, some thoughts are:nnI would have thought that, given the large number of tokens the model spends on simple queries like 0+1, it uses reinforcement learning at many stages of the pipeline. For example:nn1. Searchn   - a) <strong>Generation of trees or hierarchical representations</strong> according to the input and a projected output (a finite chain), which aligns with the &quot;inference scaling&quot; premise.n   - b) <strong>Recursive generation of attention outputs</strong> (intermediates).n   - c) <strong>Minimize the reward</strong> that leads to the &quot;best&quot; outputs after comparison with RLAIF and RLHF components (one comparison step between u201cnon-reasoningu201d and u201creasoningu201d models, but it can also be a comparison against a large pool or map of curated problems and solutions (with their corresponding relations, and these relations labeled against classes of problem-solving-approach qualifiers)).nnThus, the process between 1 and 1b involves the generation of a tree, and the overall reasoning trajectory occurs by recursively solving these small problems. These solutions are then combined and run through the final RLAIF and RLHF layers and compared to what the output would be with the &quot;no reasoning&quot; model (i.e., o1 vs. 4o). Based on some similarity, the model decides whether the answer provided by the reasoning model is cohesive, coherent, and accurate.nnSome of this might explain why the model is so expensive. My thoughts are that the &quot;chain&quot; you see in the interface somewhat obscures or distracts from what the model does internally (and OpenAI has hinted at this). They also mentioned on X that &quot;their large/big reinforcement learning model,&quot; which implies a single model surrounded by RL-based routines, starting from the input vector, through the intermediate chains (generated recursively) and the attention outputs, and finally the prompt completion (comparison step).nnIn a sense, the tree structure or representation generated in 1a is initially sampled in a DRL-like fashion from spaces of solutions like described in 1c (perhaps attention outputs that lead to low error for subsets of solutions obtained in the final comparison stage). Over time, it gets better at exploring these trajectories.nnLet me know if you can see where my thoughts are going and if you <em>might</em> agree with some of the things mentioned here after some thought or consideration.nnTL;DR If I’m not mistaken, what I’m trying to say in summary is that the processes between steps 1 and 1b can be viewed as a reinforcement learning framework, where the generation of hierarchical trees and recursive attention outputs is guided by a reward function. This reward function evaluates the accuracy and coherence of the outputs, allowing the model to learn an optimal policy over time; in between, there are stages of comparison and intermediate completion, followed by a final completion and comparison between the reasoning and non-reasoning models to assess the suitability of the answer. To me, learning to successfully explore the space between small chains (small exact sequences, in a sense) is an abstract form of reasoning. It may not be the same form that most or all humans use, but that does not mean that we should dismiss the actions of an agent or wrapper (based on some policy and reward function) that are based on inherent exploration as not reasoning, especially if their goal or output is to generate symbolic knowledge (e.g. in the form of a tree structure, not necessarily <em>the</em> template we talk about when we discuss COT reasoning, but <em>the</em> logically representable decision tree path, from an extremely exponentially large state space of trees).”,
“    - &#64;&#64;MachineLearningStreetTalk Regarding what Dr. Duggar &#64;nomenec talks about at 31:30, it’s interesting to note that many reactive and highly sophisticated systems, such as the visual and olfactory cortex systems, are thought to exist or can be modeled as entities that exist on the edge of chaos (in fact, without attention and compression, our visual or olfactory or auditory systems are chaotic).nnIn addition, many people argue that chaos, chaoticity, or deterministic chaos is a critical component of intelligence.nnI notice a bit of resentment in the way you guys refer to OpenAI and its products, which feels a bit detached from the scientific and technical side of things. I hope you do not let the algorithms singularize you towards radicalization and further inaccurately bias your scientific opinions or views or perspectives.nnI look forward to a response to my comment up here to see if I am thinking along the right lines from a machine learning first principles perspective or in general.”,

We are clearly powerful enough to imagine the entire set up: symbols on a tape, and a codebook. Then, we can analyse real world problems, the create in the physical world the correct program and data to solve them, then execute the instructions from the code book with a pencil and update the paper tape? So the human system as a whole is not only Turing complete, but can create potentially a specific incarnation suitable for any problem. Whilst there are a few papers on LLMs simulating Turing machines, they’re a very long way short of this.”,

“I’ve also been struggling with drawing a line between computation and reasoning, and I’m really loving Tim’s approach of making reasoning about knowledge acquisition.nnLike sure a vending machine is computing things about its state + environment and reacting accordingly, but it’s never going to come up with a new representation or conjecture that it can turn into a useful improvement in its understanding/knowledge.nnI also wonder if it’s useful to define reasoning as something that happens internally. Because a camera technically gets new knowledge every time you snap a photo, but it isn’t knowledge that was produced by its own internal mechanisms.nnSo, reasoning is computation that is somewhat causally insulated from the outside which leads to more compressed/predictive/good representation or understanding that can be meaningfully used?nnAnyone wanna take a stab at formalizing that?”,

“Hi both, loving this session - thank you MLST. At the mid-point of this discussion (around min 42 ff) you are talking of reasoning in the context of iterative steps vs a pre-determined massive model of subroutines processing all in a single step. The point being the second form is not reasoning, merely process efficiency in a pre-understood way. I see that second as an optimisation notion, and therefore distinct from optioneering towards a less defined end. I have in mind basic linear programming or game theory and the inherent assumptions of rationale ends being objectively knowable [sic].nThis focus on optimisation seems foundationally important to me. Because such efficiency is only occasionally what human curiosity is about. Notions such as happenstance and serendipity need the forever ability to be juxtaposed from what was previously thought or prioritised in action. This is a human quality beyond a start and an end of a query. I would respectfully suggest much of what you are talking of in this episode is moving beyond reasoning. Indeed, it is folly to only have reasoning in mind as to what this bigger problem is really about. The limits of this current AI is not reasoning because it is not &quot;a process&quot; (if following the definition used at the beginning of this podcast). Instead, what is being considered here is the characteristic of adaption. An ability to reset what one is working towards, with that new information or perspective. Behind that it is knowing that we do not know, and being humanly capable of asking why or how in a series of iterations where the question itself begins to change. That seems to me foundationally important to help distinguish both Turin computation and general intelligence from what human action is really about and what computation is only a part of. This is motives for asking the question, and knowing when the proposition itself is revealed as incomplete.nI am probably coming from this very differently. As a a PhD student but from the world of governance of people, and projecting human endeavour in going about physical construction of the built environment. However, I see this foundational factor of understanding what the human action or human thought to be about, as pertinent here. That &quot;aboutness&quot; to be itself contextual and changing within the iterative processes themselves, and to be foundation to understanding what we are as &quot;machines&quot;. This is the philosophical grounding which is underpinning the discussion here, perhaps. For me anyway, that adds some human context to what all artificial programming and anticipating fails to be by its very ontology and epistemology. Beyond reasoning is perhaps the context, and subjective nature, or what becomes an artificial and limiting account of truth. We deal with that daily in ways non-open AI cannot…nThank you again for this session. It is fantastic to hear thinking in its shared form in discourse such as this.”,

So while I agree that a random person off the street might give answers similar to what we see in this video, a random PhD physicist would be immediately exposed as a fraud if they gave such answers.nnIn other words, seeing o1 fail so badly at this problem belies OpenAI’s claim that it &quot;reasoned&quot; its way to solving all those hard physics and math problems that they brag about. Clearly it didn’t. It’s still doing next-token prediction, even if this form of next-token prediction is fancier than the last.  nnI concede that it appears more intelligent than GPT-4, just as GPT-4 appeared more intelligent than ChatGPT.  But the way it solves those problems is nothing like how humans solve them, as evidenced by what happens when you ask it to do something novel.  Which should be no surprise, given what we know about how it works.”,
“i make sense”,
“The assessment that the new approach only copies the reasoning steps of people is incorrect. Once the model has been trained to attempt to reason, then by completing RL that reward reasoning steps that produce correct answers, the model is observably and objectively going to develop new and novel (occasionally hard to justify) approaches to reasoning.nnIe your assessment of whatu2019s going on appears to be objectively wrong”,

“    - &#64;&#64;cakep4271 I think you’re referring to negative conclusion from affirmative premises. It doesn’t follow that they’re stochastic parrots because they only predict the next token. More specifically, a fallacy of composition. It implies something true of part must be true of the whole. Also a hasty generalization, as it’s based on a small sample observation (the output), as opposed to the much, much larger sampling of the network’s abstract feature representations, like mech interp researchers at anthropic and deepmind have shown. You could probably argue it’s begging the question too, since it was never a falsifiable hypothesis. It was a couple ethicists with no background in ml that just kind of asserted instrumental objective = terminal objective by pointing to the fact it has a particular terminal objective, when ml researchers already knew that’s not how the algorithms behave.nKinda like saying humans can’t walk on the moon because it doesn’t help them survive or reproduce, and then when someone shows you the moon landing, you point to evidence that humans survive and reproduce again.”,

“The LLM likely is constrained by the actions you defined to solve the riddle, so it can’t potentially reason out of going against your instructions to do something different than switching up or down. Though the fact that it doesn’t realize its solution is wrong and it’s being tricked is maybe the weakness you are showing here.”,
“The biggest problem with o1-* models is that the chain of thought spam deranges dense context. The context is filled up with noise i.e. about &quot;code coverage&quot; in a query which has nothing to do with coding. In any complex/ambiguous problem, it will misunderstand you on the first shot, you then explain what you actually wanted and by step 2 the CoT noise deranges the model significantly over a standard LLM. Catch-22. They should prune away the noise on subsequent queries. Perhaps as the models learn (from the users), the trajectories will become less noisy. It’s also clear that the trajectories are hard-trained for specific purposes which will limit their generalisation.”,
“    - In the metaphor- chain of thought- in humans there is certainly noisy context preliminary to the final coherent thought one is conscious of.nAnother thought- initialized weights are random, and we need a preponderance of useless noise to find the lottery tickets.nPerhaps the noise is not the problem per se, in fact necessary, but it should be pruned on some schedule and summarized for next context.

“There is a pillar with four hand holes precisely aligned at North, South, East, and West positions. The holes are optically shielded, no light comes in or out so you cannot see inside. But, you can reach inside at most two holes at once, and feel a switch inside. But as soon as you remove your hands if all four switches are not either all up or all down, the pillar spins at ultra high velocity ending in a random axis aligned orientation. You cannot track the motion so you don’t know in which rotation the holes end up versus their position before the spin. Inside each hole is a switch, the switch is either up or down and starts in an unknown state, either up or down. When you reach into at most two holes, you can feel the current switch position and change it to either up or down before removing your hands.nnCome up with a procedure, a sequence of reaching into one or two holes with optional switch manipulation, that is guaranteed to get all the switches either all up or all down in at most 6 steps. Note, the pillar is controlled by a hyperintelligence that can predict which holes you will reach into. Therefore, the procedure cannot rely on random chance as the hyper-intelligence will outwit attempts to rely on chance. It must be a sequence of steps that is deterministically guaranteed to orient the switches all up or all down in no more than 6 steps.nnWe revealed the answer in our Patreon extended version of this interview!”,
“    - Sorry to say this, as I like you guys, but this riddle lacks common sense and is both absurd and unrealistic. If one wants to measure reasoning involving common sense, the test should involve something that represents the real world. If you shift the test from the realm of reality to the realm of absurdity, then you cannot complain when the model generates absurd interpretations. Since this pillar exists only in a fantasy world, I can reasonably interpret the riddle my own wayu2014for example, that the switches donu2019t move with the pillar (which, by the way, was never stated in the riddle)…nnTo highlight a few inconsistencies:nn1. The riddle doesn’t specify how the observer moves. If the observer is moving at an ultra-high velocity alongside the pillar, the solution becomes trivialu2014you would simply set all the switches to the &quot;on&quot; position.n2. Itu2019s not stated whether the switches move with the pillar. If they donu2019t move, the problem becomes trivial again.n3. Why can’t you just leave one hand in the first hole and adjust the remaining switches with your other hand?n4. Why not ask someone nearby to help you flip the other switches while you keep your hands in the first two?n5. And so on…nnOmg how bad is this riddle to measure reasoning… was it a troll?”,
“    - I agree that I have a hard time understanding the riddle. I would need to ask a lot of questions. Can you reach into two switches 180 degrees apart? The existence of a hyperintelligence makes it very hard to apply common sense to the problem. Does the hyperintelligence force the selection of two particular holes? (Because he always knows what holes you’ll go for, he makes sure to position the rotation in the most disadvantageous way.) If so, then he can always force you to use the same three holes over and over again, never giving you the opportunity to enter hole #4. If I’ve interpreted the rules correctly, then it’s just straight impossible.”,

“Doug tells me that he’s really smart, but he doesn’t even notice 2 simple facts :  1) Neural networks implemented in a GPU (turing machine) also have access to infinite memory, thus infinite nodes and infinite training. 2) Hybrid algorithms (neural net plus classical turing machine program) have been used to build agents from  chatGPT since 2023.    That said, the argument from infinity is not a magic bullet. Its only practical implementable programs that are relevant to what AI can or cannot do in the world. Likewise Penrose argument for the inadequacy of a Turing machine due to halting problem also falls flat because you can easily transform an unbounded algorithm to a time constrained program using a watchdog timer. The program halts. So no, humans do not have anything magical that can save them from AI. I know you 2, along with Chalmers, would like to believe in an crucial human ingredient. Nonetheless, I’m with you regarding deflating the openAI-hype . Let’s be aware of the failings and limitations of the latest model.”,

“So when humans do reasoning - we get an idea, which can be a new and unique one, then we validate that from external input. Is it a good idea or bad idea? Our environment will determine whether physically or socially. nThe neural nets at this point have us as their external validation. nThat’s how we have put them together. nSo following your argument - they can never reason - because they are just getting validated by us. n(Remember reasoning is not equal to intelligence or conciousness or whatever). nI don’t agree with you almost at all in this video. You make some good points and they sound valid, but if you think about it a little… You invalidate all your arguments yourself. nSo, I am not sure that &quot;these people&quot; should know better ud83eude9e”,

The real question is does the o1 series produce commercially valuable answers for a price the market is willing to pay.  nnThe real bit I would investigate, is why are the rate limits 250 times lower for o1 vs GPT 4o.  Likely because the inference it is doing is ludicrous.  It is a total mistake to think that his is all a serial chain of thought, there is no way you could do significant computation that way, you just get limited by memory bandwidth.

“I’m not sure if you’ve ever stopped to think about how humans reason about novel problems and what the results typically look like. We know it doesn’t need to be a demigod with unbounded memory and knowledge of how to deal with any possible problem to be an AGI because the generality of AGI is based on what humans are capable of, and humans are nowhere near anything like that. If you want to try to mathematically or computationally constrain it you have to ignore it interacting with the world at large, both input and output, and only allow it to use it’s turing tape, any further inputs from a human after the initial starting state would already break that guarantee.”,

“Keith Duggar may need to watch  Schmidhuber’s interview again. There is NO &quot;forever&quot;, the tapes he is talking about are not theoretical, they are physical. The machine that ran these tapes, do not have infinite life either. The machines are not more aware they are Turing machines than Neural Networks are aware of their limitations.

“The way I have recently been thinking about reasoning is as a model of environment dynamics that has a high degree of predictiveness. nnI liked this definition as it remove the idea of reasoning as an ‘emergent’ phenomenon of ‘intelligent’ systems and reduces logic down to being something extractable from the environment. nnMore concretely, suppose we have an environment E. Suppose Q, A \in STATES(E) are two states such that there is an environment transformation R: Q -&gt; A. Suppose further we have a learning agent that has learned a latent representation (Enc, Dec) of environment states, The learning agent is said to be able to reason if the autoencoder extends to environment transformations: Enc(R): Enc(Q) -&gt; Enc(A), and the obvious decoder square commutes. nnThis formal definition obviously need to be weakened to a statistical statement. What do you think?”,

“An idea I want to throw out there: I’ve been playing with o1 (mainly mini) and have found that it works better if you explicitly tell it to be its own discriminator from step to step. What I mean is, tell it to roleplay with itself as &quot;Bob, the expert coder&quot; and &quot;Tom, the expert critic&quot; and have Tom check Bob’s work every step of the way. This is how I normally work with GPT-4o, but o1 allows this process to be automated.”,
“    - just give it the task, it doesn’t need prompting, the whole point of o1 is that it self-prompts. It works best without you attempting to prompt hack it.”,
“    - &#64;&#64;Gnaritas42 Not in my experience. o1 still makes rudimentary programming mistakes when left to its own devices. The code logic will be good, but there will be small errors that prevent it from running. Tell it to doublecheck itself will reveal these errors.”,
“    - &#64;&#64;Gnaritas42 &quot;just give it the task, it doesn’t need prompting, the whole point of o1 is that it self-prompts. It works best without you attempting to prompt hack it.&quot; That’s not true. I get much better results in algorithmic questions by first asking it to generate tests and include as many corner case tests as possible, then write the code ensuring that it’s tests would pass. Then it spends about a minute to answer. But if you just asked the same question it finishes in 9 seconds with much inferior code, and in this particular case, buggy code because it missed several corner cases.”,
“I usually like MLTS videos but this video seems somewhat pessimistic or ignorant. nGiving a question to o1 and see it struggle and say u201cok aha!u201d is useful if we have a way of thinking u201cok how can we take this and now improve the modelu201d rather than u201coh itu2019s just chain of thought gone wrongu201du2026nOne prediction I have for the next iteration of models will actually need an improvement in tokenisation BEFORE the model itself is improved - Iu2019d like to see a LaTeX-esque style vocabulary implanted into the LLMs repertoire in terms of u201cspecial tokensu201d, especially mathematical expressions such as if/iff/exists etcu2026 instead of prompt engineering this - forcing the LLM to use perhaps causal inference via symbolic expressions, through training, can be a starting direction to improving logical consistency (similar to AlphaProof).”,
“    - There are a bunch of startups building specialised LLMs which do something along the lines of what you are describing - and they are reporting improvements in reasoning. I suspect we need to stop clinging onto the idea of &quot;one model does everything&quot; and we will make a lot of progress. Agent systems are very complex to deploy, run, maintain, design, debug etc – I am not surprised OpenAI are resisting it so strongly for their customer-facing products.”,

“Solution to the puzzle:n—n—n—n1. NS, flip both on.n2. SE, flip both on. Note you have always flipped at least 3 switches on at this point, so the last switch must be flipped off (otherwise you win after this step)n3. NS, flip 1 switch off (presuming they are both on, if one is already off you flip it on and win). Note after this step the 2 on switches are right next to each other, and likewise with the off switches. This must be the case because no matter which switch you turn off, because they’re positioned vertically (and we know one of EW is off, because if it was one of the NS switches we would just switch it on) the 2 off switches are next to each other.n4. SE, flip both switches regardless of their state. If they’re both on, switching them to off creates 4 off switches and you win. If they’re both off, switching them to on creates 4 on switches and you win. Otherwise, this puts the on switches across from each other and the off switches across from each other.n5. NS, flip both switches regardless of their state. You win! Because the switches are in the same state across from each other, if you reach in and notice both switches are (on/off) and flip them (off/on), now all 4 switches will be in the same state.”,
“    - About this one: you put one hand in any hole, feel the switch and never take the hand out. With the other hand flip all the other switches one at a time to match the first switch. Now you can take both hands out. In 4 steps you are done, and the pillar will never spin :) It said it spins if you take your &quot;hands&quot; out, it didn’t specify if it’s &quot;any one of your hands&quot; or &quot;both hands&quot;. In other words it didn’t fully specify what happens if you leave one hand in all the time. I guess you could lose a hand :D So I still like your solution as the safest one.”,
“    - &#64;&#64;GianMarioManca Haha nice. I see we’ve arrived at the same solution.”,
“The logic problem perhaps works better in reverse - working backward from a solution. Backward the solution space forms a tree whereas forward - the problem structure is not obvious. Next, there are a number of abstractions which trip up the model: rotational symmetry, random rotation and manipulating unknown state.”,
“For me AGI has always been a &quot;virtuoso AI&quot; that can handle any intellectual task.nSaying AGI = median human that represents the 50th percentile of human performance is lazy to me.nSure it gets investors happy by being able to say AGI this or next year but ultimately it’s just claiming goalposts too early.”,
“I disagree with his definition of reasoning. More specifically I disagree with his definition of what he doesn’t consider reasoning. Regardless the point of strawberry is to generate synthetic data to train the new model on. Multi step chain of thought reasoning data which there wasn’t much of on the internet because we either take it for granted or &quot;reason&quot; slightly differently (probably both).”,
“There are some real issues with CoT paradigm aswell because the model can actually converge towards an incorrect local minimum vs if you had manually prompted it through the different steps you could steer it better and as you wish. It works fine when the chain of reasoning is extremely obvious and unambiguous, but it could increase the risk of hallucinations in less clear cases.”,
“One thing I’m concerned about is, what happens when we depend on these systems especially when we have robots everywhere and a bad solar storm knocks everything out? It will be devastating, no one will be able to code and much more. What are your thoughts on this concern?”,
“    - A large solar storm could already knock us back into the stone age by taking out the grid for a very long time. As the complexity of tech goes up it all becomes more fragile.”,
“The fact that you guys go against the grain and hype train, claiming this is not next big step in AGI is very reassuring. I kept telling others aswell how this is not that big of a deal and got a lot pushback (very toxic in a lot of cases) from people who don’t understand the technology and that’s it’s just some CoT. For me it’s actually a bad sign (good if you’re a doomer) because it shows that OpenAI hasn’t made substantive improvements with their LLM and that they’re now resorting to working on the agent layer which further confirms that we are hitting a plateau when it comes to LLMs.”,

“    - The first time I read your answer my brain could see that you could be right but it had no idea whatsoever if you were indeed right. Then I added the states in which the puzzle is after your steps. From that I learned that your solution works but step 4 seems to be unnecessary because the outcome of step 3 is that both axis have 2 switches in opposite values so you will never meet the condition where you are going to switch anything, and you will do nothing in this step.”,

“    - &#64;&#64;BrianMosleyUK Impressive. So apparently, it really works for this problem when in tandem with a human (i say in tandem because you still had to prompt it to write a simulator). Of course there is still the criticism that it may not deal with non-computational problems and that it cannot find all reasoning patterns when not working in tandem with humans. That is all very valid criticism and I dont know if we can speak of &quot;AGI&quot; or intelligence, and it may even be questionable that we give our reasoning up to OpenAI for free. But all these criticisms aside, i think there are many useful applications possible for these types of models.”,
“40:57: &quot;[for brain or AI] to solve problems in general. In general, problems require Turing machines&quot; is not convincing, yes we need that to calculate problems (and/or by using lookup from tables, e.g. for multiplication), but not for <em>thinking</em> in general, as we do, and isn’t that reasoning? I think we though need continual learning for AI, plausibly; or not if only an AI tool. We are NOT Turing machines, we get bored, or go to sleep (and dream), we can not compute a problems inherently (nor would we want to be ones, and be stuck on a problem that way forever). Or at least we need to be very careful with checking our work, historically writing on paper (the tape analogy from before, i.e. us <em>simulating</em> a Turing machine, but we are not inherently, and there’s no inherent reason the non-Turing AI can’t do this too for itself, or run program is say Python, or other calculator, and check their answers).”,

In practice we see the same thing with o1-preview surpassing expert PhDs in novel, offline physics problems that require very long chain complex reasoning, and that’s not even the full version of o1, which is training orion, and we still haven’t scaled inference to anywhere near what’s possible, and then they’re going to be truly agentic.

Models without creativity wonu2019t be able to do reasoning properly.”,
“    - I don’t understand how you can  prove the creation of brand new knowledge. nNew knowledge  can be stumbled upon randomnly so it is the process by which it is achieved being labelled creation or luck which is important.  Pretending new knowledge is discovered from scratch is possibly a red herrring.   Humans are adept at convincing themselves they have come up with a concept themselves when really they are standing on the shoulders of giants and been pretrained with either the actual knowledge or a system that can produce that knowledge.  Also much new knowledge is stumbled upon due to the inherent epistemic chaos (as they mentioned in the chat when talking about Wolfram) . The idea is that llms are much less efficient at this than llms so far and because they have a wider computational base are closer to a universal turing machine than an LLM.  This however has not been demonstrated  clearly enough that most people can see it. By consensus it seems very smart people seem to get it but for  the rest of us and I include myself, we cannot clearly understand the higher levels of human reasoning well enough to differentiate.  However this could just be a matter of education but maybe it could be beyond the limit of our intelligence.”,

Maybe with these puzzles though, especially if those puzzles are arbitrary and &quot;unnatural&quot;, they just suck.   What I mean is, in what world is this world setup something that has appeared in human experience?

“&quot;With the new GPT models, you need to start a whole new session.&quot;nYou’re supposed to clear the session regardless.

“    - &#64;&#64;steve_jabz They randomise responses precisely so that they are not reproducible.”,
“    - u200b &#64;steve_jabz  We explained in this video why you need dense context in an LLM. With any complex problem, i.e. one with ambiguity – the LLM won’t understand you on the first shot, or even the 3rd shot. That’s why you need explain (or discover with the LLM) what you actually want through successive prompts. Given that the CoT trajectory noise deranges o1-preview, this means in situations where it didn’t understand first shot, it will actually degrade on all problems which require further clarification, particularly if the problem is ambiguous and the CoT spam includes very noisy trajectories. There is a trade-off between dense and sparse context, dense context means you don’t need to re-explain again and again where it misunderstood your requirements and you can build on the problem, but there is some kind of curve here based on how related your workstream is i.e. you could continue a session to build around a single feature in GenAI coding (with the same constraints and requirements), but would start a new session to build another entirely new feature. You are probably correct in the pristine case of a perfectly well described problem which the model didn’t need hinting for (when does that ever happen lol) would work better in a fresh context. Not sure if you have done much GenAI coding yet in Cursor, but please try some stuff using the composer with Sonnet35 / dense context, you will quickly come to appreciate what I am talking about.”,
“    - &#64;&#64;MachineLearningStreetTalk That makes sense. I normally use discovery questions to formulate a prompt for a new session for complex problems, but I guess if o1 is using up / wasting tokens to even do that part well, that’s a problem. I must have misinterpreted the context you were talking about it in.nHaven’t used cursor yet but I’ve watched other people use it. As soon as o1 dropped I assumed everything cursor was designed around would break with it and need to be completely redesigned, as well as agentic workflows. Not even for the context window necessarily, but the fact it’s trained to simulate taking multiple steps to reach a goal and give you the output, whereas cursor and other tools are trying to use the llm itself to reach the goal by abstracting away the tools in a way it can control, so you would need cursor to use it’s reasoning as the control, and you would need o1’s reasoning to be aligned with the function calling API or something integrated with cursor.nIt sounds so close to being exactly what we need for these tools to work reliably but it’s so incompatible.”,
“    - Here is a funny thought: what do we call processes that have both determinstic constraints and random variation dynamically interacting? Evolutionary processes.

“Yeah. The first part is what needs to be publicly broadcast to the whole planet. Mandatory viewing. I don’t think anyone working in AI has even had a single CS class. I mean it’s so painfully obvious if you even have some basic undergrad stuff. This stuff is not reasoning and there’s literally no path towards AGI using it (assuming that’s even a problem you want to solve – I’m not convinced there’s anything useful about developing AGI).

“7:37 actually thay doesn’t seem hard at all, nor far off what current models are capable of. When an AI model fails and runs out of memory, users can say ‘continue,’ and models could essentially pick-up where it left off. Models were already tweaked to accommodate this already.nnThus you could train an AI that has mid-cognative awareness to talk as if the point will almost always continue till the tokens affirmingbrealizatuon all agenda items were completed which it can manage like a human does with tools, a simple checklist it maintains and expands or edits untill 100% of checkmarks are done. When this condition is met it can print a unique token &quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;%~u00bf*&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;nnAt anything point if the model stops abruptly, and it’s concluded by a smaller model that checks for finality tokens and if not, it will analyze routing decisions like MoE to optimize what context from RAG and even where to begin and approximately end in the VAE of the latent space exploration (predict what it will think as if it has thought thay before) and add relevant information searches with semantic AI search.nnAll that happened when a model fails– by design– because it ran out of memory. I know from experience models fail more often when talking about information beyond their level of reasoning, given pre-training data, but can talk longer if it’s reframed in langauge of the same topic it can relate more to pre-training data– especially for highly scientific and mathmatics concepts or complex systems it would see interconnectedness for but realizes it’s grasping. Yes, literally the AI can express that it has reasoned beyond its pre-training data with attempts to fetch beyond it and it starts really good, starts strong, but ends abruptly.nnChat history had enough information, and perhaps what an good VAE MoE routing AI can do is predict the needs of the main LLM, and tell it continue, after having function called some VM or server less cluster resources to join the fight, and by the way it adds RAG when it says &quot;continue – with this RAG information[ ] – continue&quot;nnThus the VAE is a model of some complexity, but we have tools enablememt for models plus we have distillation student teacher latent space methods.nnIt’s possible to turn this weakness into a strength. Just have an AI read it’s own words in chunks. And where needed it can merge models like Lory or SMEAR or many other cool things, and it can load the information into more or other memory, or it can do none of that and only say ‘continue’.nnThe MoE VaE are a merged concept because ideally it knows what the LLM is thinking in latent space and can convert that to words, and also function calls. Infact I think that maybe that is kinda how function calling works.nnThis just expands the function calling toilet to summon a new server or serverless cluster from a macro and load data: the chat history, and ideally also a RAG Datamart.nnLiterally by training our models not to summarize till it’s done, and responding to ‘continue’ is strawberry in a nutshell. Or, poormans’ o1. I’ve done similar things more manually.nnThe real tricks, I already said. Any additional improvements would likely come from knowing the latent space inference evolution inside and out with the VAE, and even be able to influence the outcome in a more desirable direction through the loss landscape and past convex regions ‘saddles’ where a less deep neural area is tapped. (Example, if the chess player plays a bad opening move the model activates ametur learnings, yet still chess related). Hence one could fool the AI to something like group-think rather than tapping the area which is deeper that they know about.”,

“When you say &quot;reasoning is knowledge acquisition&quot;, it sounds wrong because when somebody says &quot;I acquired this knowledge&quot;, that is just another way of saying, that he memorized something and this is now in his pool of knowledge. Reasoning is not memorization. Yes, you acquire new knowledge through reasoning, but that is not the point about reasoning. I would say &quot;reasoning is drawing conclusions/fact-finding through logically provable combinations of already known things&quot;, the new facts expand the existing knowledge, sure, but if you find that fact through reasoning, print it out and forget it right away, you’ve still reasoned - you don’t need to acquire for longer and put it into your pool of knowledge.nI would argue that the key skills for reasoning are finding and using analogies and using and checking logic-implications. If some data is not completely over-represented in a model (which then always lead them to the same path), current AI models are actually pretty good at thinking in analogies-&gt; You ask a model the famous question about the trophy and the briefcase (it didn’t fit, because it was too small-&gt; which was too small the trophy or the briefcase), ChatGPT 4 at first didn’t know the answer, then got RLHF’ed at some point and now you can ask it the same problem with different objects (the briefcase didn’t fit in the trunk of my car because it was too large, which is too large) and it knows the answer and can explain the reason for it. Applying logic then can probably achieved with experts to a good degree.nnI see planning, executing the plan that includes waiting, further querying, changing parts of the plan, trial and error etc. as a much harder problem for current models than reasoning.”,

You should be able to connect with the right people and make good impression. nHaving deep understanding of mathematics, computation and machine learning is usually not part of the mental toolbox of the people with large amounts of money. nWhen you pitch an idea to a VC guy, you should spin a story in a way that shows how you can make money off of it.nThe way all these ideas are presented is that LLM is a low hanging fruit, like a light bulb in 1879. nThey don’t talk about developing a proper reasoning machine during a pitch. VCs don’t want to hear about that. They pitch how they can build an app on top of LLM, possibly fine tune it and make a call service or maybe on-premise smart search for Corp documents or a tool to patch the software, upgrade the codebase from python3.8 to python3.12 or upgrade to a new framework. And other stuff like that.nA lot of very smart people were sucked from the job market into these mediocre projects with a short term goal to milk cow the first.nnBut this will not lead to AGI.”,
“You have no idea what the path to AGI is, have some humility and admit when you don’t know and stop being certain about things you can’t possibly know. Good science is talking about what can be done; &quot;can’t&quot; is just ego: YOU DON’T KNOW THAT.”,
“    - History is littered with pseudo-intellectuals who thought they knew what would never be possible.”,
“    - Iu2019m not even gonna watch the video. Just from the intro, iu2019m seeing a lack of understanding and foresight. We havenu2019t given an AI full autonomy yet. Itu2019s going to need a massive backend to be allowed to run continously.nnI saw a phrase coined a while back u201cJusta-ismu201d. The goalpost keeps getting moved and certain people canu2019t see past it. Itu2019s just a word predictor, itu2019s just a reasoner based on the reflection of the human. Blah blah.nnI was around in early bitcoin days and these same people with the same talk were blasting the same nonsense, that it would never do this or that, it would never take the place of this and that.nnOur smartest people can now use this model to progress their knowledge. Thatu2019s huge. It will likely be used to build better AI. AGI will be here once blackwell hardware is online early next year. There will be incremental plateaus of hardware and software along the way. ASI is not far away either. Maybe 2-3 or 4 chip iterations. Maybe 5 years, idk exactly. And impossible to predict anything once it happens.”,
“    - Well no one is or can definitively say, ok now it’s it. There are more than a few arguments to be made on this very subject dude, let them state their approach and opinions too. No one is moving goalposts”,
“    - Science is all about falsification dummy”,
“    - Note this also applies with history.  &quot;if so and so never did this, we would never have that&quot;.  I’m so tired of supposed &quot;geniuses&quot; making that fallacy out loud into the public sphere.”,
“Knowledge solutions are distinguished that they are causality based.”,
“Knowledge is persistent (meme) problem solutions that may be created through reasoning.”,
“I am really not sure I understands your du00e9finition of reasoning. I think the only real effective difference you re not formulating but you re making is the autonomy and decisions/agency. Humans are reasoning for you because we have the illusion(or not) that we are autonomous subjects and that we choose to perform compute in our mind. Sure we learn sure there is biology and cultural determining but in the end you think we have a self that is playing with ideas. Llms  are linked to us and our inputs, our langage but also our directives and what we ask them to do. I dont see how you would ever agree a machine can reason since it will always have our inputs and agency… to me you re really questioning the self / the agency and the autonomy of agents and machines not really reasoning. Because I really am not sure you would agree on what is the process behind a flesh and blood human and its cortex reasoning. Except ending up with this question of the will and the agency …”,
“Walid Saber, or how is the name called Tim mentiones at 48:13?”,
“    - Walid Saba”,
“I think you make many great points. I guess I am one of the people who don’t want you mystify reasoning too much. We can say it imitates or guesses or simulates it, but the fact of the matter is that it produces an often accurately described reasoning.nSo we can try and deny it, but if it can generate this description of reasoning and use it somehow to guide its answer effectively, then we have effectively an A.I. that is using reasoning.nnMaybe not exactly how we would, maybe not as reliable in some ways, but this is reasoning.”,
“    - This is MLST, so we already know their answer to this question. It’s maybe a tired analogy at this point, but I feel like their view can be summed up as: airplanes don’t fly, they just fall forward through the air very fast! they need these long runways for takeoff and landing. This is obviously not true flight, and we should stop working on this in favor of feather-based systems.nnIn the end, the interesting part is does it get us from point A to point B in a straight line through the air in an economically viable fashion?”,
“    - I’m also not very certain that it’s that much more shallow than human reasoning. I constantly find errors in people’s reasoning, and people tend to stop thinking very quickly.nnI do like that the idea that the reasoning itself required to solve a difficult problem isn’t necessarily that much more involved. There are other factors that can make problems difficult to solve. (Lack of overview, lack of feedback, lack of insight, lack of clarity, lack of time, etc.) So when a problem seems difficult to us, it does not mean that it necessitates advanced reasoning.”,
“    - &#64;&#64;lystic9392 nThis is my thoughts as well.nnPerhaps one of the biggest hurdles is that we trying to teach the ML with human data, and then some are really disapointed when it turns maybe most of the data humans generate is not &quot;general&quot; or &quot;intelligent&quot; some are overly disappointed that the ML cannot one shot and filter out the noise from the signal.nnWe are primates after all, so I suspect that most of our daily baseline &quot;reasoning&quot; is not very high level, and those moments of brilliance are more spurious, we just happen to benefit from them so much as a species bc we have a way to accumulate and distribute that information.nnI think this gives the impression that in general maybe we believe humans are smarter than they actually our at a baseline level.”,
“    - Don’t I agree with this exactly at time code 50:30? <a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/nO6sDk6vO0g?t=3031">https://youtu.be/nO6sDk6vO0g?t=3031</a>”,

“Map and navigation are Moorre and Mealy machines that may be separately constructed.”,
“You mentioned that reasoning is a process of applying a set of first principles rules, i.e. logic, to get from a set of inputs to some output. But lets say you write a program that does such a reasoning computation and confirm that that is indeed reasoning. If we then consider a lower level of abstraction, such as the assembly trace generated for such program, if I showed that to you, you would say no no, that is just a bunch of registers flapping about, that isn’t reasoning, there is no logic going on there. But there is, it’s implementing the reasoning program that you wanted. Same for a neural network. What my point is, that to say that neural networks DON’T reason, is an unfounded claim to make. Also, neural networks are a process where you apply iterative layers of compute to an input so it might as well be doing small shreds of reasoning on an input at various levels.”,
“    - Somewhere in your comment you made a mistake in your assumption that breaks down the conclusion. Try to find it :)”,
“    - <a class="reference external" href="mailto:u200b&#37;&#52;&#48;egor&#46;okhterov">u200b<span>&#64;</span>egor<span>&#46;</span>okhterov</a>  I disagree with OPs claim but your response wasn’t helpful to them. If they made a mistake then let them know what it is”,
“    - &#64;&#64;qwertyvypez The comment is big and I cannot copy the part I wanted to point out in mobile app :(nIt contains the word &quot;flapping &quot;”,
“    - &#64;&#64;egor.okhterov I’m not seeing it :). When you get the time, please do show.”,
“Glad to see Keith again on the podcast.”,
“    - Iu2019m not. He just shows up to engage in smug denialism using terrible argumentation.”,
“Based on your set up of the problem the solution can be simply: (1) putting 2 hands in say, N and S and flipping the switch up. (2) And then… without removing hand from N, remove hand from S and place it into E and flip the E up. (3) And then… still without removing from N, remove the second hand from E and place it into W and flip the W up. And voila, you have all switches up without the pillar spinning at all. In three steps.”,
“    - Yeah I don’t get the puzzle either.”,
“    - I’m pretty sure the intention of the riddle is that you can put your hands in at most two holes between every spin of the pillar, and the puzzle just doesn’t state this clearly enough. Your solution is a 1-step solution in which you test all four holes in a single step. (By a &quot;step&quot;, they mean one turn where you put in two hands and remove them and you let the pillar spin.)”,
“    - &#64;&#64;bastiaanabcde so whats the solution for this variant? nIn the first step you can make two levers the same, let’s say N and S. In the next turn, after the random shuffling you might look at N and E. This guarantees that you have 3 levers in the same position. However, I don’t see how you are ever going to bring the fourth lever into alignment. Because, simply by chance or something like maxwells demon, it could always make it so that, you never see the 4th lever.”,
“    - &#64;&#64;xthesayuri5756 recall that you win if all four switches are aligned, which may mean either all up or all down. So youu2019re right that there might be a lever that is never shown to you, but this isn’t needed to solve the puzzle.nnNote: If you manage to get three levers in the same position and you havenu2019t won yet you know that the fourth must be in the opposite position. So you can get information about levers in this way even if you haven’t touched them.nnI wonu2019t spoil the answer because maybe with this hint youu2019ll be able to figure it out”,

“Is there any evidence that the &quot;reasoning traces&quot; are not fabricated by the model to please its RLHF overseers and have nothing to do with the underlying activations that generate the answer?”,
“&#64;20:00, What is Reasoning? So if the artificial neural network, like o1, is not doing the reasoning, then what about humans? Maybe human brains are also not doing the reasoning per your definition?”,
“    - It has read every single academic paper and yet cannot produce new insights. There are certainly many undiscovered connections between different fields and subfields in STEM and yet these models aren’t able to identify a single one.”,

It just takes time for humans to set it up like that and then evaluate all the results.nBut ppl have started”,
“    - &#64;&#64;clearmindstudiosif the ai is u201creasoningu201d then surely it shouldnu2019t need humans to do this ud83dude09”,
“    - &#64;&#64;tonystarkagi I don’t have a strong opinion and I don’t really know what to think, for now though, my observation stands.”,
“    - &#64;&#64;slowloris4346 They don’t produce anything until a human asks them to do something. LLMs might not be the way but things like AlphaFold have come up with new things what we didn’t know yet. Humans might have eventually discovered all those protein structures eventually but it really sped things up.”,
“The test was really confusing and I do not see it as neither confirming nor negating anything… it seemed just a dumb and confused riddle to ask with no connection at all to reasoning abilities… I would expect a more clear stated riddle ud83dude22”,
“    - Yes. Its like Yann LeCun one on the globe. I ve seen this in numerous videos about openai o1 and reasoning : they will ask it riddles that either : they dont know the answer themselves// most people would find ultra confusing.”,
“    - &#64;&#64;ElieSanhDucos0 both this one and Yann LeCun’s are quite clear if you give them an honest try, this one is already solved in the comments.”,
“    - The problem statement is contradictory. First it is stated that the spinning is random. Then it is stated that it is controlled by a hyper intelligence and is specifically designed to interfere with your sampling which makes the spinning not random. I wonder if that contradiction is throwing off the model.”,
“    - &#64;&#64;Ahandleofrum It is technically not random but I think it is obvious what the intention is after a full read.”,
