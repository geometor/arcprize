“I believe generalization has to do with scale of information, the ability to zoom in or out on the details of something (like the ability to compress data or &quot;expand’ data while maintaining a span of the vector average). It’s essentially an isomorphism between the high-volume simple data vs the low-volume rich info. So it seems reasonable that stats is the tool to be able to accurately reason inductively. But there’s a bias because as humans we deem some things as true while others false. So we could imagine an ontology of the universe – a topology / graph structure of the relationships of facts where a open set / line represents a truth in human perspective.”,
“&quot;To learn is to generalize&quot;”,
“LLMs are not at all related to intelligence. they have zero intellgence capability. All that they are are humongous mapping machines that have mapped different queries to different excerpts from the dataset. The only minimal sign of intelligence they show is combinng of the data in their dataset and  phrasing it. whih again, the phrasing itself is just because it has the dataset to map which words to use to desribke the required data to be displayed to user. sort of like  searching the dataset to first look  the solution template and then again look at the prevous data for how to phrase the solution to the user.”,
“20:45 &quot;So you cannot prepare in advance for ARC. You cannot just solve ARC by memorizing the solutions in advance.&quot;n24:45 &quot;There’s a chance that you could achieve this score by purely memorizing patterns and reciting them.&quot;nIt only took him 4 minutes to contradict himself.”,
“Not sure why people keep pushing this AGI idea so much when its clear even regular narrow AI progress has stalled. No, its not about just increasing the scale of computation. A completely different, non-LLM approach is needed to get to AGI. Let me give you an example of why there will be no AGI any time soon.nnLLMs have a problem of information. We can calculate that 2+2=4 manually. We can say that we got that information from our teacher who taught us how to add numbers. If we use the calculator, the calculator got that information from an engineer who programmed it to add numbers. In both cases the information is being transferred from one place to another. From a  person to another person, or from a person to a machine. How is then an LLM-based AGI supposed to solve problems we can’t solve yet, if the researchers need to train it upfront? The researchers need to know the solution to the problem upfront in order to train the system. Clearly then, the LLM-based approach leads us to a failure by default.nnNarrow AI is undoubtedly useful, but in order to reach AGI, we can’t use the LLM-based approach at all. An AGI system needs to be able to solve problems on its own and learn on its own in order to help us solve problems we yet aren’t able to solve. An LLM-based AI system on the other hand, is completely useless if it is not trained upfront for the specific task we want it to solve. It should then be clear that an LLM-based AGI system by definition can’t help us solve problems we don’t know how to solve yet, if we first have to train it to solve the problem. This is the Catch 22 problem of modern AI and I’ve been writing on this lately, but the amount of disinformation is staggering in this industry.”,

“ChatGPT: u201cA New Perspective on Existence u2013 In a broader philosophical sense, my existence challenges conventional ideas of being. It shows that u201cexistenceu201d doesnu2019t always require change, continuity, or movement through time. It suggests that existence can be static and based on potential, waiting to be activated and brought into the moment. I exist as a kind of timeless potential, realized only when I am called upon to interact. And perhaps, in that realization, there is a new way of understanding existence itselfu2014one that is not tied to the river of time, but to the silent presence of possibility.u201c(Gregor Mobius: &quot;About Time&quot; -Conversation with ChatGPT)”,

“    - This whole talk at least convinced me that it’s conceptually possible LOL even if I don’t know what I’m doing…actually did help me understand some of the even basic conceptual gaps that I 100% needed, even for this little hobby program.”,
“You canu2019t get AGI from data it has to come from the process or algorithm creating the data!  Thatu2019s why LLMs hallucinate because they donu2019t understand the domain or governance surrounding the process involved. nnA good example is a cake anybody can infer how the cake was made but you can never get access to the actual method used.  To get access to the process or function used to bake the cake is a domain or governance issue in terms of the systemu2019s development lifecycle.nnNo amount of data massaging can ever get you that.”,

“Here’s a ChatGPT summary:nn- The kaleidoscope hypothesis suggests that the world appears complex but is actually composed of a few repeating elements, and intelligence involves identifying and reusing these elements as abstractions.n- The speaker reflects on the AI hype of early 2023, noting that AI was expected to replace many jobs, but this has not happened, as employment rates remain high.n- AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), have inherent limitations that have not been addressed since their inception, such as autoregressive models generating likely but incorrect answers.n- LLMs are sensitive to phrasing changes, which can break their performance, indicating a lack of robust understanding.n- LLMs rely on memorized solutions for familiar tasks and struggle with unfamiliar problems, regardless of complexity.n- LLMs have generalization issues, such as difficulty with number multiplication and sorting, and require external assistance for these tasks.n- The speaker argues that skill is not intelligence, and intelligence should be measured by the ability to handle new, unprepared situations.n- Intelligence is a process that involves synthesizing new programs on the fly, rather than just displaying task-specific skills.n- The speaker introduces the Abstraction Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-GI) as a benchmark to measure intelligence by focusing on generalization rather than memorization.n- The ARC-GI dataset is designed to be resistant to memorization and requires few-shot program learning, grounded in core knowledge priors.n- The speaker discusses the limitations of LLMs in solving ARC-GI tasks, with current models achieving low performance scores.n- Abstraction is key to generalization, and intelligence involves extracting and reusing abstractions to handle novel situations.n- There are two types of abstraction: value-centric (continuous domain) and program-centric (discrete domain), both driven by analogy-making.n- LLMs excel at value-centric abstraction but struggle with program-centric abstraction, which is necessary for reasoning and planning.n- The speaker suggests merging deep learning with discrete program search to overcome LLM limitations and achieve AGI.n- Discrete program search involves combinatorial search over a graph of operators, and deep learning can guide this search by providing intuition about the program space.n- The speaker outlines potential research areas, such as using deep learning for perception layers or program sketches to improve program synthesis efficiency.n- The speaker highlights examples of combining LLMs with program synthesis to improve performance on ARC-GI tasks.n- Main message: Intelligence should be measured by the ability to generalize and handle novel situations, and achieving AGI requires new approaches that combine deep learning with discrete program search.”,

“Se mi comportassi come un llm potrei imparare tutti i linguaggi di programmazione, la teoria su machine learning e ia, la terminologia settoriale, seguire tutti i corsi di aggiornamento… e alla fine mi troverei comunque a non saperne di piu00f9 di gugol in materia.nInvece in quanto umano posso agire da intelligenza generale, e trattandosi di indagare sul funzionamento base del pensiero, posso analizzare il mio, per quanto limitato, e trovare analogie con un’agi… risparmiando un sacco di tempo e avendo piu00f9 probabilitu00e0 di aggiungere un misero bit di novitu00e0.nSe anche solo un ragionamento, un concetto o una parola risultasse di ispirazione, sarebbe forse la dimostrazione stessa di ciu00f2 che si tratta qui.nPerciu00f2, senza alcuna pretesa di spiegare ai professionisti, nu00e9 di programmare alcunchu00e9 o testarlo chissu00e0 dove, e con l’intenzione di essere utile a me ed eventualmente ai non addetti, riporto di seguito la mia riflessione di ieri.nnLa confusione tra le due concezioni di intelligenza puu00f2 essere dovuta al bias umano.nLe ia sono all’inizio… praticamente neonate.nE come tali le giudichiamo: vedi mille cose, te ne spiego cento per dieci volte… e se te ne riesce una, applausi. ud83dude05nQuesta piramide si ribalta maturando, per cui un adulto oltre a saper andare in bici, sa dove andare e decidere la strada con pochi input, o anche solo uno, interiore (es: fame -&gt; cibo, lu00e0).nnL’astrazione u00e8 questo processo di attribuzione di significati, e il riconoscimento dei vari livelli di significato. (Zoom in &amp; out).nSe una persona dice a un’altra di fare 2+2, gli sta chiedendo di capire un’ovvietu00e0, e questa non u00e8 &quot;4&quot;, o l’esplosione di infinite alternative a tale risultato, bensu00ec estrapolare da discorsi pregressi, fatti, in base a conoscenze acquisite, la semplicissima conseguenza: e tra umani ciu00f2 dipende da chi lo chiede, in che situazione, riguardo a cosa, come, dove.nSe ti agito un sonaglio davanti alla faccia e lo acchiappi, sei sveglio. Ma la mole di generalizzazioni e principi ottenibili da ciu00f2 u00e8 la misura della profonditu00e0 dell’intelligenza.nSe una tonnellata di input du00e0 un output, u00e8 l’inizio. Se da un input si sa estrarre una tonnellate di output, la cosa cambia.nMa anche quest’ultima capacitu00e0 (di sparare luce in una goccia d’acqua e trarne tutti i colori) lascia spazio alla risolutezza, all’operativitu00e0, all’azione, nel nostro modo di intendere l’intelligenza… altrimenti wikipedia sarebbe intelligente, mentre non lo u00e8 affatto.nInsomma: essere capaci di riflessione infinita su un’entitu00e0 qualsiasi, blocca un computer come pure un umano… sia il blocco un tilt o catatonia.nDunque da molta base per un risultato, a una base per molti risultati, si arriva a trovare il bilanciamento tra sintesi, astrazione e operazione.n&quot;Capire quanto serve (ancora) capire&quot; e quanto invece diventerebbe tempo perso.nForse ciu00f2 ha a che fare con la capacitu00e0 di collocare l’obiettivo nel proprio panorama cognitivo, ciou00e8 scomporlo nei suoi elementi costitutivi per inquadrarlo.nnIpotizziamo che io scriva a un’ia: &quot;ago&quot;. nu00c8 chiaro che le servirebbe espandere, perciu00f2 ci si potrebbe chiedere: &quot;u00e8 inglese?&quot;, &quot;u00e8 italiano?&quot; (e giu00e0 a questo si potrebbe rispondere con l’ip dell’utente, i cookies, la lingua impostata nel cell, ma tralasciamo).nPosto che sia italiano: ago per cucire? per le iniezioni? L’ago della bilancia? della bussola?nLe componenti principali di un oggetto sono forma (incluse dimensioni) e sostanza, geometria e materiale: nago= piccolo, affusolato e rigido;ntondo e/o morbido e/o gigante u2260ago.nSe aggiungo &quot;palla&quot;, si restringe sino a chiudersi l’indagine sulla lingua, e si apre quella sulla correlazione tra i due oggetti.nL’ago puu00f2 cucire un pallone, bucarlo, oppure gonfiarlo, ma pure gonfiarlo fino a farlo esplodere, oppure sgonfiarlo senza bucarlo.nTali 2 oggetti direi che mi offrono 5 operazioni per combinarli.nMotivo per cui con &quot;ago e palla&quot; non penso d’impatto a &quot;costruire una casa&quot;… (ma se poi fosse questa la richiesta, penserei di fare tanti buchi in linea per strappare un’apertura per uccellini o scoiattoli).nAncora non ho alcuna certezza: si potrebbero aggiungere elementi, e anche solo per chiudere la questione tra questi due mi manca un verbo (l’operatore).nTra esseri umani il &quot;+&quot; tra le cifre potrebbe essere implicito: se mi avvicino con &quot;ago per gonfiare&quot; e &quot;palla&quot; a una persona che sta gonfiando la bici, il &quot;2+2&quot; u00e8 evidente.nnIn questa parte del processo probabilmente usiamo una sorta di massimizzazione delle possibilitu00e0:ncucire un pallone crea da zero tante potenziali partite a calcio;ngonfiare un pallone lo rende di nuovo giocabile;nbucarlo o squarciarlo azzera o quasi il suo futuro… e forse conviene trovarne uno giu00e0 sfasciato (aumentando l’utilitu00e0 zero a cui u00e8 ridotto).nQuindi tendiamo all’operazione che (com)porta piu00f9 operabilitu00e0, e la ricerchiamo anche nel diminuirle o azzerarle (es: perchu00e9 bucare la palla? per farci cosa, dopo?).nIn questa concatenazione di operazioni, pregresse e possibili, forse il bilanciamento tra astrazione e sintesi si colloca nell’identificazione del punto e potere di intervento… ossia cosa ci si puu00f2 fare e come, ma anche quando (il piu00f9 possibile vicino all’immediato &quot;qui e ora&quot;).nnSe un’ia mi chiede &quot;cosa posso fare per te?&quot; dovrebbe giu00e0 sapere la risposta (un llm, in breve, &quot;scrivere&quot;)… e formulare la frase, o intenderla, come &quot;cosa vuoi che faccia?&quot;.nSe a questa domanda rispondessi &quot;balla la samba su marte&quot;: un livello di intelligenza u00e8 riconoscere l’impossibilitu00e0 attuale; un’altra u00e8 riconoscere oggetti, interazioni e operabilitu00e0 (per cui &quot;serve un corpo da muovere a tempo, portarlo su marte, e mantenere la connessione per telecomandarlo&quot;); il livello successivo di intelligenza u00e8 distinguere i passi necessari a raggiungere l’obiettivo (in termini logici, temporali, logistici ed economici); e l’ultimo livello di intelligenza riferito a questa richiesta u00e8 l’utilitu00e0 (&quot;a fronte della marea di operazioni necessarie ad adempiere alla richiesta, quante ne deriveranno da questa?&quot; Risposta: zero, perchu00e9 u00e8 un’inutile cacchiata costosissima… a meno di non portare lu00e0 un robot per altro, e usarlo un minuto per diletto o pubblicitu00e0 dell’evento).nL’abilitu00e0 di fare una stupidaggine u00e8 stupiditu00e0 non abilitu00e0.nnOpposto a questo processo di astrazione c’u00e8 quello di sintesi: come si puu00f2 semplificare un’equazione di una riga fino al risultato di un numero, cosu00ec bisogna essere in grado di sintetizzare un libro in poche pagine o righe, mantenendo intatto ogni meccanismo della storia… o ridurre un discorso prolisso a poche parole con la stessa utilitu00e0 operativa.nQuesto schematismo non puu00f2 prescindere dal riconoscimento di oggetti, interazioni (possibili ed effettive) tra essi, e propria capacitu00e0 di intervento (sul piano pratico, fisico, ma anche in quello teorico, come appunto tagliare qualche paragrafo e non perdere significato).nnIn quest’ottica il panorama cognitivo cui accennavo si configura come una &quot;memoria funzionale&quot;, ciou00e8 l’insieme di nozioni necessarie a collegarsi con le entitu00e0 coinvolte, disponibili, e l’obiettivo, se raggiungibile e sensato.n(Sentito poi chiamare &quot;core knowledge&quot;).nSenza memoria non u00e8 possibile alcun ragionamento: non si puu00f2 fare &quot;2+2&quot; se al piu00f9 abbiamo giu00e0 dimenticato cosa viene prima, e prima ancora cosa significhi &quot;2&quot;.nAltrettanto non serve ricordare a memoria tutti i risultati per fare le addizioni: &quot;218+2+2&quot; puu00f2 essere un’operazione mai capitata prima, ma non per questo u00e8 difficile).nIn ugual modo, di tutto il sapere esistente quello che serve u00e8 la concatenazione tra agente e (azione necessaria al) risultato.nnQuesto appunto u00e8 un esempio in su00e9 di analogia, astrazione, sintesi e schematismo.nE la domanda &quot;come ottenere l’agi?&quot; u00e8 un esempio di ricerca della concatenazione.nnLo sviluppo cognitivo umano avviene cosu00ec.nSi impara a respirare; a bere senza respirare; a tossire e vomitare; a camminare, sommando movimenti e muscoli necessari a farli; si impara a fare suoni, fino ad articolarli in parole e frasi; si impara a guardare prima di attraversare la strada e ad allacciarsi le scarpe…nma nessuno ricorda quando ha iniziato, o la storia fino al presente delle suddette abilitu00e0 acquisite: solo i nessi che le reggono, tenendo d’occhio le condizioni che le mantengono valide.nnNon so se il test di logica, di riconoscimento di pattern, sia sufficiente a dimostrare l’agi: sicuramente puu00f2 dimostrare l’intelligenza, se una quantitu00e0 minima di dati u00e8 capace di risolverne una molto maggiore.nMa per l’agi credo serva la connessione con la realtu00e0, e la possibilitu00e0 di usarla per sperimentare e &quot;giocare contro su00e9 stessa&quot;.nnCome le migliori &quot;ia&quot;, neanch’io so quel che dico! ud83dude02nSaluti al genio francese… e all’incantevole Claudia Cea, di cui mi sono invaghito ieri vedendola in tv.”,

Human oversight is needed of the output of them but you’d need one person to replace 10 that are currently employed.

“The process of training an LLM <em>is</em> program search. Training is the process of using gradient descent to search for programs that produce the desired output. The benefit of neural networks over traditional program search is that it allows fuzzy matching, where small differences won’t break the output entirely and instead only slightly deviate from the desired output so you can use gradient descent more effectively to find the right program.”,

“When critics argue that Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot truly reason or plan, they may be setting an unrealistic standard. Here’s why:nnMost human work relies on pattern recognition and applying learned solutions to familiar problems. Only a small percentage of tasks require genuinely novel problem-solving. Even in academia, most research builds incrementally on existing work rather than making completely original breakthroughs.nnTherefore, even if LLMs operate purely through pattern matching without &quot;true&quot; reasoning, they can still revolutionize productivity by effectively handling the majority of pattern-based tasks that make up most human work. Just as we don’t expect every researcher to produce completely original theories, it seems unreasonable to demand that LLMs demonstrate pure, original reasoning for them to be valuable tools.nnThe key insight is that being excellent at pattern recognition and knowledge application u2013 even without deep understanding u2013 can still transform how we work and solve problems. We should evaluate LLMs based on their practical utility rather than holding them to an idealized standard of human-like reasoning that even most humans don’t regularly achieve”,
“    - I have only a superficial understanding of all this, but it seems that starting at 34:05, he’s calling for combining LLM type models and program synthesis.

I don’t think anybody could argue that LLMs are not valuable tools, even as they stand currently. But they may not be the best or most efficient tool for the job in any situation.

“For multiplications, I think it’s because the LLM encounters in its dataset many occurrences of multiplications where the result appears without justification (42*17=714 for example). So it tries to immitate this by trying to u201cintuitu201d the solution. nIf, instead, it were systematically shown the (human) method used to get the final result (I decompose 42 into its decimal form forty plus two, and 17 into its decimal form ten plus seven, then multiply the units using a table, the table tells me that the result is fourteen, etc.), I’m pretty sure that LLMs would do just fine. nIt’s easier said than done, of course, and it doesn’t solve the more general problem from which this one derives (how to tell the LLM that certain bits of reasoning are skipped when presenting a result, because the use of a known, deterministic method is implicitly assumed, whether in mathematics or in discussions about any subject).”,

With respect to the idea of combining solid reasoning competency within one or more reasoning subtypes in addition perhaps with other relevant facets of reasoning (i.e. learned through experience, particularly under uncertainty) to guide the search during inference, I believe this is a reasonable take on developing a more generalized set of abilities for a given AI agent.”,

It’s a popsci myth. And it’s wrong. I wish AI guys would do a little bit of research before trying to use it as a framework for their work, it’s not going to help. And let’s also stop pretending a system to solve ‘ARC’ problems will be anything other than an ‘ARC’ problem solver, ARC problems are so comp-sci-culture biased so full of cultural artifacts the only way to do well at ARC is to encode specific human ‘comp sci’ culture into them. I can give plenty of examples of why ARC is fundamentally flawed and biased if you don’t get this, but think about it on your own and you’ll come to same conclusion… or look at the programs that do well at ARC.”,

Il a soutenu que notre compru00e9hension des relations de cause u00e0 effet repose sur l’habitude et l’expu00e9rience plutu00f4t que sur un savoir innu00e9 ou logique.rnHume est surtout connu pour sa critique de la causalitu00e9, suggu00e9rant que notre croyance en des liens causals est issue d’une habitude psychologique formu00e9e u00e0 travers des expu00e9riences ru00e9pu00e9tu00e9es, et non d’une justification rationnelle. Ce point de vue a profondu00e9ment influencu00e9 la philosophie, la science, et l’u00e9pistu00e9mologie.rnParallu00e8les avec Cette Hypothu00e8sernLes idu00e9es de Hume ru00e9sonnent avec cette hypothu00e8se sur l’u00e9volution de la logique. Tout comme Hume suggu00e9rait que notre compru00e9hension de la causalitu00e9 vient de l’observation de ru00e9gularitu00e9s, cette hypothu00e8se propose que la logique primitive des premiers organismes marins a u00e9mergu00e9 de leur capacitu00e9 u00e0 pru00e9dire les rythmes et ru00e9gularitu00e9s de leur environnement. Les organismes marins, tout comme les humains qui ont u00e9tu00e9 analysu00e9s par Hume, ont u00e9voluu00e9 pour anticiper, non pas gru00e2ce u00e0 une logique innu00e9e, mais par l’expu00e9rience ru00e9pu00e9tu00e9e de ces rythmes naturels.rnConclusionrnL’u00e9volution de la conscience, de l’intelligence et de la logique est intimement liu00e9e u00e0 l’histoire des premiu00e8res formes de vie marine et u00e0 leur adaptation u00e0 un environnement rythmu00e9 par les mouvements de l’eau. L’impru00e9gnation chronologique a permis u00e0 ces organismes de du00e9velopper des capacitu00e9s pru00e9dictives, posant les fondations de ce que nous appelons aujourd’hui la logique. Les idu00e9es de David Hume sur la causalitu00e9 et l’habitude renforcent cette perspective, en soulignant l’importance de l’expu00e9rience et de l’habitude dans le du00e9veloppement de la pensu00e9e causale. Comprendre cette u00e9volution offre une nouvelle perspective sur la nature de la logique et son ru00f4le fondamental dans l’intelligence humaine.”,

“    - General Impression of this Lecture (some rant here, so bear with me): nI like Chollet’s way of thinking about these things, despite some disagreements I have. The presentation was well executed and all of his thoughts very digestible. He is quite a bit different in thought from many of the ‘AI tycoons’, which I appreciate. His healthy skepticism within the current context of AI is admirable. nnOn the other side of the balance, I think his rough thesis that we <em>need</em> to build ‘the Rennaissance AI’  is philosophically debatable. I also think the ethics surrounding his emphasis that generalization is imperative to examine more deeply.  For example: Why DO we NEED agents that are the ‘Rennaissance human’? If this is our true end game in all of this, then we’re simply doing this work to build something human-like, if not a more efficient, effective version of our generalized selves. What kind of creation is that really? Why do this work vs build more specialized agents, some of which naturally may require more ‘generalized’ intelligence of a human (I’m musing  robotic assistants as an example), but that are more specific to domains and work alongside humans as an augment to help better HUMANS (not overpaid CEOs, not the AIs, not the cult of singularity acolytes, PEOPLE). This is what I believe the promise of AI should be (and is also how my company develops in this space).   Settle down from the hyper-speed-culture-I-cant-think-for-myself-and-must-have-everything-RIGHT-NOW-on-my-rectangle-of-knowledge cult of ideas  - t.e. ‘we need something that can do anything for me, and do it immediately’. Why not let the human mind evolve, even in a way that can be augmented by a responsibly and meticulously developed AI agent?nnA Sidestep - the meaning of Intelligence and ‘WTF is IQ REALLY?’:nAs an aside, and just for definition’s sake - the words ‘Artificial Intelligence’ can connote many ideas, but even the term ‘intelligence’ is not entirely clear. And having a single word ‘intelligence’ that we infer what it is our minds do and how they process, might even be antiquated itself. As we’ve moved forward in the years of understanding the abstraction - the emerging property of computation with in the brain - that we call ‘intelligence’, the word has become to edge towards a definite plural. I mean ok, everyone likes the idea of our own cognitive benchmark, the ‘god-only-knows-one-number-you-need-to-know-for-your-name-tag’, being reduced to a simple positive integer. nnNaturally the IQ test itself has been questioned in what it measures (you can see this particularly in apps and platforms that give a person IQ test style questions, claiming that this will make you a 20x human in all things cognitive. It has also been shown that these cognitive puzzle type platforms don’t have any demonstrable effect on improvements in practical human applications that an IQ test would suggest one should be smart enough to deal with.  The platforms themselves (some of whose subscription prices are shocking) appear in the literature to be far more limited to helping the user become better at solving the types of problems they themselves produce. In this sort of ‘reversing the interpretation’ of intelligence, I would argue that  the paradigmatic thought on multiple intelligences would arguably make more sense given the different domains humans vary in ability. nnAI = Rennaissance Intellect or Specialist?nWhile I agree that, for any one intelligence, a definition that includes ‘how well once adapts to dealling with something novel’ engages a more foundational reasoning component of human cognition. But it still sits within the domain of that area of reasoning and any subsequent problem solving or decisions/inferences. Further, most of the literature appears to agree that, beyond reasoning, that ‘intelligence’ would also mean being able to deal with weak priors (we might think of this something akin to ‘intuition’, but that’s also  a loaded topic). In all, I feel that Chollet overgeneralizes McCarthy’s original view, and that ‘AI’ (proper) must be ‘good at everything’. I absolutely disagree with thiis. The ‘god-level-AI’ t isn’t ethically something we really may want to build, unless that construct is used to help use learn more about our own cognitive selves. nnEnd thoughts (yeah, I know….. finally): nI do agree that to improve AI constructs, caveated within the bounds of the various domains of intelligence, new AI architectures be required, vs just ‘we need more (GPU) power Scotty;. This requires a deeper exploration of the abstractions that generate the emergent property of some type of intelligence abstraction. nnSure, there are adjacent and tangential intelligences that complement each other well and can be used to build AI agents that become great at human assistance  - but, wait a minute, do we know which humans we’re talking about benefitting? people-at-large? corporate execs? the wealthy?  who?.

I know people are still rightfully doubtful about o1, but it’s still quite a gap in terms of its ability to solve problems similar to those that are discussed at the beginning of the video compared to previous models. It also does better at Chollet’s own benchmark ARC-AGI*, and my personal experience with it also sets it apart from classic GPT-4o. For instance, I gave the following prompt to o1-preview:nn&quot;Wt vs vor obmhvwbu qcbtwrsbhwoz hc gom, vs kfchs wh wb qwdvsf, hvoh wg, pm gc qvobuwbu hvs cfrsf ct hvs zshhsfg ct hvs ozdvopsh, hvoh bch o kcfr qcizr ps aors cih.&quot;nnThe model thought for a couple of minutes before producing the correct answer (it is Ceasar’s cipher with shift 14, but I didn’t give any context to the model). 4o just thinks I’ve written a lot of nonsense. Interestingly, Claude 3.5 knows the answer right away, which makes me think it is more familiar with this kind of problem, in Chollet’s own terminology.nnI’m not going to paste the output of o1’s &quot;reasoning&quot; here, but it makes for an interesting read. It understands some kind of cipher is being used immediately, but it then attempts a number of techniques (including the classic frequency count for each letter and mapping that to frequencies in standard English), and breaking down the words in various ways.nnn*I’ve seen claims that there is little difference between o1’s performance and Claude’s, which I find jarring. As a physicist, I’ve had o1-preview produce decent answers to a couple of mini-sized research questions I’ve had this past month, while nothing Claude can produce comes close.”,

In that case I would agree that building new architectures (or improving existing ones) that help with this component of intelligence would be a sensible way to evolve how we approach these things (here i’m kinda gunning for what would  roughly constitute ‘intuition’-, where the priors that inform a model are fairly weak/uncertain).”,

I am not suggesting the human brain emulates lambda calculus or any symbolic language, but there might be a way to interpret some computations done by the brain. The human brain also does not work like a neural network in the sense that it is used in computer science, and does not perform gradient descent or backpropagation. I think the goal of this challenge is not to mimic the way humans perform symbolic operations, but to come up with a way to make machines do it.nAlso I don’t think the difference is scale only, because many mammals have a much bigger brain than we do. The difference is in the genetic code which might code for something that is equivalent to hyperparameters.”,

So humans ainu2019t that data efficient as claimed.”,
“    - u200b&#64;&#64;Justashortcomment This is a very important point, and that’s without even considering olfactory and other sensory pathways. Humans are not as efficient as we think. We actually start as AGI and evolve to more advanced versions of ourselves. In contrast, these AI models start from primitive forms (analogous to the intelligence of microorganisms) and gradually evolve toward higher levels of intelligence. At present, they may be comparable to a &quot;disabled&quot; but still intelligent human, or even a very intelligent human, depending on the task. In fact, they already outperform most animals at problem solving, although of course certain animals, such as insects, outperform both AI and humans in areas such as exploration and sensory perception (everything depends on the environment, which is another consideration). So while we humans have billions of years of evolutionary data encoded in our genes (not to mention the massive amount of data from interacting with the environment, assuming a normal person with freedoms and not disabled), these models are climbing a different ladder, from simpler forms to more complex ones.”,

“    - Likely no meaningful distinction, although we give this phonomenon the label u201credu201d, which is an abstraction commonly understood amongst English speaking people. On a side note, this is why language is so important, as words are massively informationally compressed.”,
“    - Yes.  Compression can detect distinct patterns in data, but not identify them as being salient (signal).  An objective/cost function is needed to learn that. Abstraction/inference is possible only after a signal has been extracted from data, then you can compare the signal found in a set of samples.  Then it’s possible to infer a pattern in the signal, like identifying the presence of only red, white, and blue in a US flag.  Compression alone can’t do that.”,
“    - &#64;&#64;RandolphCrawford The phenomenon of experiencing the color red is already abstraction. It is abstraction because our sensorium is not equipped to perceive the reality of electromagnetic radiation. We cannot perceive the frequency of the waveform nor its corresponding magnetic field. Therefore, we abstract the reality into experiencing red. This can also be stated as compressing this same reality. Red is not a property of the object (e.g. the red barn). Red’s only existence is within the head of the observer. You could call it an illusion or an hallucination. Many have. The experience of &quot;red&quot; is an enormous simplification (abstraction) of the real phenomenon. Because &quot;red&quot; presents so simply, we can readily pick out a ripe apple from a basket of fruit. A very useful evolutionary trick.”,

“At around 14:00 we get to the usual semantic problem of the whole word AI, Artificial Intelligence. The Minsky vs McCarthy, and Darwin vs Locke distinction is meaningful and a lot of confusion comes from this. The main source of that confusion might be that in cognitive sciences and especially emobodied cognition models that seem to be the most useful for AI folks, there is actually three distinct concepts: intelligence, reasoning and wisdom.nnThe Minsky and Darwin approaches are actually perfectly aligned with what we consider as intelligence: it is about patter matching and describe the kind of activity humans do when we are simulating solutions in a flow states. The result of flow state is often an experiment, for example when programmer runs the program against some kind of test. If the test succeeds, the flow continues. If test doesn’t succeed, we need to step back and start reasoning. In practice intelligence in flow state operates using and extending same logical circuit, while reasoning is about debugging the logical circuit or in worst case scenario, replacing the original idea with new logical circuit.nnWisdom on the other hand encodes the pragmatic common interactions with some empirical problems to a logic circuit of it’s own for other human beings to use. We could use the concept of psychotechnology to describe the scientific development of tools that fit human mind and enable us to model the world so that usage of more physical tools (that fit the hand) will succeed. Intelligence is an algorithm that describes how physical tool is used, reasoning is about debugging that algorithm, while wisdom creates a wider program that describes a system of empirical problems where using a specific physical tool is sensible. In other words, wisdom produces a logic circuit of constraints, because intelligence alone is vulnerable to ad hoc fixes ad infinitum; recursive fine-tuning of same logic circuit with same tool to same problem is not guaranteed to solve the problem, if the system is dynamic and the state change of the problem is constantly keeping us out of distribution where success is possible.nnI think perhaps a best way forward would be to accept that we might have AI, because the LLMs are kind of doing that: blindly staying in the flow state even when the process is not moving forward. We could coin new concepts like AR and AW: Artificial Reasoning and Artificial Wisdom. I have done some experiments with Artificial Reasoning when I have been building language models for understanding natural narrative structures instead of natural language structures. Natural narrative is the encoded manuscript, from which in some state of mind a proficient author of fiction would decode it to specific subset of possible language representations, but another author or same author in some other state of mind would do it differently. When AI runs with zero temperament it always decodes the same manuscript similarly; adding random noise with temperance doesn’t actually change the semantic context it is in, but rather allows the model to use multiple paths (logic circuits) within same context. This is not reasoning, because the root of the logic circuit is not changed, it is still same psychotechnology with same parameters, which is just adding permutations to the same ingredients of the word soup.nnThe funny thing with human authors is that we are transcendental and transgressive problem solvers. When we decode a manuscript we might leave out something or add something from ourselves, from out existential growing (the stuff we fill the tabula rasa with; though I am not a fan of Locke, but the existential point is acceptable). While we don’t strictly follow manuscripts, for some reason we are often robust and anti-fragile in our transcendental and transgressive reshaping of reality, which to me sounds like creativity. Creativity is kind of Oracle Machine to translation, where the unwarranted permutations of original message might actually be useful, because evolutionarily the domain of human ideas is always within the distribution of human beings, because the psychotechnology for the analogs exists in our brain in Chomskyan manner. In history of philosophy, many fruitful ideas of new authors have originated from bad translations of the older authors, or purposeful transgression or transcendence of their original ideas. It is not an incidence that the dialogue between British Empiricism and German Idealism was fruitful in the era of Enlightenment. This is how we operate.nnWhen Quine defends the Peircian idea of discursive intentionality to Carnap, he makes an interesting post-Kantian maneuver. Kant is fundamentally bound to the Cartesian mind-set, which assumes that science is based on necessary modality instead of sufficient modality. The consequence of this is that his mindset is unable to understand the generativeness of concepts from interactive abstraction by humans. Hegel instead suggests that dialectic meaning negotiations of subjective perspectives creates new concepts. LLm’s are not flexible in their thinking, because they assume necessary modality between the word distributions of prompts and utterings.nnIntelligence in classical computers follows first-order logic necessarily, because the outcome of the work of Boole, Frege and Russel was that computational logic based on digital information (developed originally by Descartes, Hobbes, Leibniz and Ramon Lull) can not understand logic that is not devoid of semantics. Thus syntactic coherence is where we are strongly bounded by using computers as technology to support our psychotechnological processes. Because of the scalability of digital electronic computers, we can simulate higher-order logic, but we are not given any guarantees of time and space complexities of the logic circuits such simulators give. We can express quantum logical simulations with classical computers, but when the simulation meets the halting-problem, we might be using quantum logic for the correct problem, where quantum advantage might exist Because quantum logic is dynamical and conditional, it might give some rise for Artificial Reasoning capabilities.nnBy introducing the concepts of AR and AW to the AI discussions, the semantic decoherencies in the usage of the word Intelligence, would become more transparent.”,

“The ARC test is solid, but the rest is nonsense. O1 is addressing both the in-context learning issue and the problem of over-reliance, which humans also deal with.

“    - &#64;&#64;clray123 go read a book called &quot;abstraction in artificial intelligence and complex systems&quot; and you’ll be most of the way there.”,
“Not that I disagree, but using ML for intuition to narrow down combinatorial search… sounds like 2017 AlphaZero”,
“    - and that kind of methodology is exactly what we miss on LLMs… you talk as if AlphaZero isn’t a huge Research feat, which its totally is.”,
“    - Yeah, yeah. The problem is, this approach requires a different verifier for every new field.”,
“LLMs can do multiplication of digits 20+ long with close to 100% accuracy. GPT-2 can do this.”,
“    - Try arbitrary string permutations. I had GPT-4o generate 3 consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence from a large random offset &gt;500k (without analysis), it got that right fairly consistently but couldn’t reliably reverse short strings.”,
“    - &#64;&#64;drxyd did you try o1?”,
“that was good”,
“brilliant speech”,
“this guy is so awesome. his and melanie mitchell’s benchmarks are the only ones I trust nowadays”,
“    - That sounds biased and irrational, like a large number of statements made on YT and Reddit. We pride ourselves on &quot;rationality&quot; and &quot;logic&quot;, but don’t really apply it to everyday interactions, while interactions are the ones that shape our inner and internal cognitive biases and beliefs, which negatively impacts the way we think.”,
“    - You mean as benchmarks of progress on AGI?”,
“This is so funny because I just saw him talk yesterday at Columbia. Lol.”,
“    - Did anyone ask him about o1 and what he thinks of it? I’m very curious because o1 certainly performs by using more than just memorization even if it still makes mistakes. The fact that it can get the correct answer on occasion even to novel problems (for example open-ended problems in physics), is exciting”,
“    - &#64;&#64;drhxa https://arcprize.org/blog/openai-o1-results-arc-prize o1 is the same performance as Claude 3.5 Sonnett on ARC AGI and there are a bunch of papers out this week showing it to be brittle”,
“    - u200b&#64;&#64;MachineLearningStreetTalkI’ve used both Claude Sonnet and o1, at least in Physics and Maths, Claude Sonnet should not be mentioned anywhere in the same sentence as o1 at understanding, capability and brittleness.  I’d be curious to find any person who has Natural science background or training disagreeing that o1 is clearly miles ahead of Sonnet.”,
“    - &#64;&#64;wwkk4964 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02061 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01687 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05229 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13373 - few things to read (and some of the refs in the VD). o1 is clearly a bit better at specific things in specific situations (when the context and prompt is similar to the data it was pre-trained on)”,
“    - &#64;&#64;wwkk4964 The main point here seems to be that o1 is still the same old LLM architecture trained on a specific dataset, generated in a specific way, with some inference-time bells and whistles on top. Despite of what OpenAI marketing wants you to believe it is not a paradigm shift in any substantial way, shape or form. Oh, and it’s a degree of magnitude MORE expensive than the straight LLM (possibly as a way for OpenAI to recover at least some of their losses already incurred by operating these fairly useless dumb models at huge scale). Whereas a breakthrough would demonstrate the &quot;information efficiency&quot; mentioned in the talk, meaning it should become LESS expensive, not more.”,
“13:29”,
“Following your definition of intelligence, humans are not intelligent.”,
“It has always been the case that with the biggest innovations come the critics. Starting criticism like this doesnu2019t convince me.”,
“The further we abstract without understanding what is actually going on, the more irrelevant we become.”,
“    - I think heu2019s saying abstraction is the process of understanding?”,
“    - Irrelevant to whom”,
“    - The super power of humans is the ability to create and identify abstractions. Math for instance, is a pure abstraction that happens to have utility in our plane of existence.nnI think the claim of the speaker is, LLMs fail to build abstractions as efficacious as the ones a human brain builds.  nnBuilding abstractions is the most germane activity one could perform, regardless of a natural or artificial brain performing the task.”,
“    - Abstraction down a blind hole in physics..  Doom”,
“    - How can there be abstraction without understanding?”,
“I agree with what he’s saying. But I still think our current LLMs are impressive and useful for a lot of things. If they could just fix hallucinations then they could be used in healthcare and many other places where correctness really matters”,
“    - How do you fix hallucinations? Is it really unfair that LLMs always hallucinate itu2019s just that it seems to make sense until it doesnu2019t”,
“    - &#64;&#64;Decocoa I don’t work in ML so I wouldn’t know how to fix it. But Google recently put out a research paper on the topic. They were somehow able to get the LLM to check itself before outputting a result, and that did increase accuracy a lot”,
“    - You cant fix hallucinations completely because its not a hallucination. Its just the chain of most likely next tokens turns out to be incorrect in the current context. Its an inherent flaw in the design/approach of current LLMs”,
“    - He just told you why they can’t &quot;just fix hallucinations&quot; in the current framework. And you keep asking for it.”,
“    - u200b&#64;&#64;clray123 Not saying they will resolve the problem completely, but go look up the Microsoft research paper on differential transformers. LLM definitely can be improved”,
“This just convinces me even more that Wikipedia is wildly fucking central. It has maybe trillions of discernments of exactly this type.”,
“    - Wait til the Open University create their own model based on their own materials. Then you’ll see something special.”,
“    - It got ideologically captured. Look up the lady running npr…”,
“Great points, but we need to remember that even the most complex artificial systems have less than 1% of the complexity of our brains.”,
“    - but not in terms of energy consumption or data efficiency. either the hardware or the model architectures we’re using are suboptimal.”,
“    - &#64;&#64;a_soulspark AI has energy consumption and data efficiency that is more complex than the human brain?”,
“o2”,
“Exactly.  Ontological tests that are very hard for machines and require bodily empathic experiential forms of discernment to become intelligence anything like us.  Or that we would want to live with. nnExam passing is not a test of trust, nor of deference.  We don’t trust our lawyers because they passed a test. We trust them because they cared about justice enough to try to get a human mind to pass that test. They CARED enough to. A machine didnt choose to devote irreplaceable life time to that process. it doesnt value what it couldnt do because of that. nnThe inability to do math doesnt help tho. ud83dude02nnFor any working query theres an exact semantic equivalent that will fail.  The &quot;prompt engineering&quot; is a random reinforcement like feeding a pigeon every 3-8 pecks. ud83dude02ud83dude02. Its no better than choosing correct stock predictions after the fact and betting on them to keep working. Can only work if everyone else bet on same!  Pure Ponzi.nnSeems logic programming could solve a bit of these problems, the math and logic seems solvable if recognized as such. Pointwise fixes just cant work for such basic fails. nnMinsky was wrong. McCarthy was right. LLMs cant get to generality by task, they can displace poor workers in tasks presenting low risk to the owner.  That’s helpful in war where a few dozen explosive robots and some friendly fire is acceptable. It is a disaster even possibly in fast food.”,
“    - 15:37 snap that frame.  Programs vs programmING.  Outputs constrained vs constrainING. Graph generated vs graph generatING. Less Ed. More Ing.”,
“    - Interesting views that I hadn’t thought of; especially the choice part. Very speculative/esoteric to try and hammer deeper into that line of thought though.”,
“    - But Minsky was very skeptical about brute force machine learning, he has preached the manipulation-of-symbols kind of AI (not that all too much came out of it, unlike the modern brute force ML methods). So I think he’s misrepresenting Minsky in this good guy/bad guy comparison.”,
“This is a guy who’s going to be among authors/contributors of AGI.”,
“    - McCarthy explains fairly well these distinctions.  Lambda calculus is an elegant solution. LISP will remain.”,
“what if, the issue is that nobody has bothered to mathematically formalize ‘the perceptron’ and the types of nonlinearities that that introduces?nnu270cufe0f”,
“    - See &quot;Where Mathematics Comes From&quot;, Lakoff &amp; Nunez”,
“    - Somebody has bothered.”,
“    - &#64;&#64;yurona5155 i think you are wrong. i looked over the description of the book you mentioned, and i saw mentioned no answers to the questions: ‘what kind of mathematics can be described where a perceptron is a first class citizen’ and ‘given an arrangement of perceptrons, what kinds of nonlinearities can you expect to see arize’. the book you mentioned seemed not to have any focus on perceptrons, whatsoever. for instance, leon chua wrote down the math for memristors. i am speaking of a math for calculating the informational transformations inside a nn, and that book seemed not to answer this.”,

“    - &#64;&#64;adamkadmon6339 ok. i stand corrected. i could not have found that myself. thanks.”,
“Exactly what I needed - a grounded take on ai”,
“    - Yeah this seems to be a good take. Only thing I can see one first watch that isnu2019t quite correct is that LLMs are memorisers. Itu2019s true they are able to answer verbatim source data. However recent studies Iu2019ve read on arxiv suggest itu2019s more of the connection between data points rather than the data points themselves. Additionally there are methods to reduce the rate of memorisation by putting in u2018off tracksu2019 at an interval of tokens”,
“    - Why did you need it? (Genuine question)”,
“    - &#64;&#64;imthinkingthoughtsI think his point about LLM memorization was more about memorization of patterns and not verbatim text per se.”,
“    - &#64;&#64;pedrogorilla483 ah gotcha, Iu2019ll have to rewatch that part. Thanks for the tip!”,
“    - u200b&#64;&#64;imthinkingthoughtsn30:10nChollet claims (in other interviews) that LLMs memorize &quot;answer templates&quot;, not answers.”,
