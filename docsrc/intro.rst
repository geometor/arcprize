This project is a collection of studies inspired by the ARC prize

https://arcprize.org

began my journey with ARC think that I it might be fun to build a system 

realized the intention in :ref:`measure` is for an agent to address the puzzles with
no previous knowledge about the puzzles

if I were to design a system (if I could) then I would be demonstrating my
intelligence

So, the question becomes: can a machine properly ingest a puzzle in a way that
it is understood
