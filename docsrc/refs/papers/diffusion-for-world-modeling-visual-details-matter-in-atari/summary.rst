summary
-------

1. Brief Overview
=================

This paper introduces DIAMOND (DIffusion As a Model Of eNvironment Dreams), a reinforcement learning agent trained within a diffusion world model.  Unlike previous world models that primarily utilize discrete latent variables, DIAMOND leverages diffusion models for image generation, enabling the preservation of crucial visual details. This approach leads to significant performance improvements, achieving a new state-of-the-art on the Atari 100k benchmark. The authors also demonstrate the standalone capabilities of DIAMOND's diffusion world model as an interactive neural game engine by training it on Counter-Strike: Global Offensive gameplay.  The code and models are publicly available.


2. Key Points
=================

*   DIAMOND utilizes diffusion models for world modeling, retaining important visual details often lost in discrete latent representations.
*   Achieves a mean human normalized score of 1.46 on the Atari 100k benchmark, surpassing previous world model agents.
*   Functions as a standalone interactive neural game engine, demonstrated through training on Counter-Strike: Global Offensive gameplay.
*   EDM (Energy-based Diffusion Model) is chosen over DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model) due to its superior stability over long time horizons.
*   Code, agents, videos, and playable world models are publicly released.
