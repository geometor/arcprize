.. section:: Brief Overview

This paper introduces 26 guiding principles designed to improve the process of querying large language models (LLMs).  The principles aim to simplify prompt creation and enhance user comprehension of LLM behavior across different model sizes.  Extensive experiments were conducted on LLaMA-1/2 (7B, 13B, and 70B) and GPT-3.5/4 to validate the effectiveness of these principles. The research found that using these principles leads to higher quality, more concise, and factual responses compared to standard prompting techniques.


.. section:: Key Points

*   Introduced 26 guiding principles for effective LLM prompting.
*   Principles categorized into five groups: Prompt Structure and Clarity, Specificity and Information, User Interaction and Engagement, Content and Language Style, and Complex Tasks and Coding Prompts.
*   Experiments conducted on LLaMA-1/2 and GPT-3.5/4 showed significant improvements in response quality and accuracy (57.7% and 36.4% average improvement on GPT-4).
*   Improvements were more pronounced with larger models.
*   Principles address issues like conciseness, clarity, contextual relevance, task alignment, bias avoidance, and incremental prompting.
*   Evaluated using a manually-created benchmark (ATLAS) with human evaluation.
