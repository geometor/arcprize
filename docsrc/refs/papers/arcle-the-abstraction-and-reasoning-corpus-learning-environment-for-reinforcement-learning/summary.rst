3. Brief Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This paper introduces ARCLE, a reinforcement learning (RL) environment designed for the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark.  ARC presents challenges for RL due to its vast action space, hard-to-reach goals, and variety of tasks. ARCLE, implemented in Gymnasium, aims to address these challenges by providing a tailored environment and a range of tools for RL research.  The paper demonstrates that an agent using proximal policy optimization can learn individual ARC tasks within ARCLE, highlighting the effectiveness of non-factorial policies and auxiliary losses.  Further research directions are proposed, including the application of MAML, GFlowNets, and World Models.


2. Key Points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ARCLE is a new RL environment for the ARC benchmark, designed to address the challenges of ARC for RL agents.
