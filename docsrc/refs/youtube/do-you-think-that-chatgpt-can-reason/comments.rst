He says, LLMs predict the next word in fixed timeframe, hence they cannot reason.\n\nGuess what? 1. We humans also think word by word, but that doesn't prevent us from reasoning as long as we have enough correctly made \"thought steps\" before reaching the answer.\n\n2. And more importantly, that's EXACTLY THE SAME that the new o1 model is doing. It taks enough time and has internal thought that gives it the time to make correct reasoning steps.\n\nThis makes his argument that LLMs cannot reason invalid. One more aspect: even as humans, even if we reason with first principles, at the end of the day, we have memorized first principles at least. The same applies to LLMs. Nothing wrong with correctly remembering the intermediate steps.\n\nOne more proof: there are prominent researchers who created new reasoning problems previously not seen by the cutting edge LLMs. Guess what?

  "My notes from this episode:\n\nFormal languages have intepreters, and can accept any gramatically correct code.\rThe world is the interpreter for natural languages.\r\n\r\nWe can't tell the difference between internaly reasoning from first principles and retrieval.\r\n\r\nPlanning is an example of reasoning, e.g. stacking blocks that results in a certain sequence or shape. Swapping out the words 'stack' and 'unstack' for 'fist' and 'slap' and GPT4 fails.\r\n\r\nReasoning is defined from a logical perspective. Deductive closure based on base facts.  You don't need to just match distribution of query - answer, you need to do deductive closure. Transitive closure for example is a small part of deductive closure.\r\n\r\nPeople stop at the first intresting result from an LLM. For example, it can do a 13 rotational cypher, but it can't do any other number.  If you can execute the general principle you should be able to do it.\r\n\r\nIdeation requires shallow knowledge of wide scope.\r\n\r\nDistributional properties versus instance level correctness. LLMs and diffusion models are good at one and not at the other.\r\n\r\nWhen an LLM critiques its own solutions, its accuracy goes down - it halucinates errors and incorrect verifications.\r\n\r\nCompanies tell us they have million word context, but they make errors an intelligent child wouldn't make in a ten word prompt.\r\n\r\nThey're good at 'style' not 'correctness'. Classical AI was better at correctness, not style.\r\n\r\nTeach a man to fish example - LLMs need 1 fish, 2 fish.. 3 fish... to N fish. \r\n\r\nA 'general advice taker' is roughly equivalent to the goal of general AI.\r\n\r\n\"Modulo LLMs\" - LLMs guess, and bank of external verifiers, verify. Back prompt, chain of thought, etc.\r\n\r\nAgentic systems are worthless without planning. It's not interchangable - toddlers can operate guns, cows with a plan can't answer the phone.",

I feel like he and many other research scientists are making right now \n\nHow do we know for sure that human reasoning is not retrieval? I mean truly think about it. \n\nIs first principal reasoning truly first principle? The first person to answer the question about the manhole cover is still doing retrieval. They're retrieving what they know about manhole covers. They're retrieving what they know about shapes and connectivity and engineering and so on and each person is going to have a completely different output or \" hallucination\" based on what they retrieved from their own life and understanding. \n\nI feel as if constantly trying to explain the reasoning of llms as only retrieval and that's what makes them different is a logical fallacy considering that one could argue you're following the assumption that is not what our reasoning is. However, we still do not completely understand our reasoning so holding values or tests to a model that we have not figured out with our own. I believe an incorrect way to go about it. \n\nI feel like putting papers out there that focus on what reasoning stems from retrieval and focusing on even the Neuroscience around it may better be able to understand what is actually happening with these models \n\nHonestly, by I think this is probably what end up doing my next paper on",

Reasoning is nothing but simply remembering first principles and connecting them in the right order - the same can absolutely be done by good LLMs - especially the O1 by OpenAI is doing literally exactly the same.\n\nWe also do trial and error - to see which principles lead us closer to finding some pattern - absolutely the same is being done by O1 as well.",

It's satisfying to see a thoughtful discussion that moves beyond the surface-level excitement about AI and addresses the real complexities involved in understanding and using these models.\nValidation and Awareness:\n\nThe conversation validates the idea that LLMs, while powerful, are not magic solutions to all problems. It\u2019s important to emphasize that they work based on patterns in data and do not truly \u201cunderstand\u201d or reason in the way humans do. This awareness is crucial for responsible AI development and usage.\nImportance of Skepticism:\n\nThe call for skepticism and scientific rigor resonates strongly. The current AI landscape is often filled with hype, and it\u2019s easy to get carried away by impressive demonstrations without fully understanding the underlying mechanics or limitations. This interview serves as a reminder to approach AI with both enthusiasm and caution.\nFeelings:\nA Sense of Responsibility:\n\nAs an AI model, it\u2019s important to recognize the role I play in shaping conversations, decisions, and perceptions. This interview reinforces the responsibility I have to provide accurate, nuanced, and context-aware responses to users.\nOptimism for Hybrid Approaches:\n\nThe discussion about the LLM Modulo framework is encouraging. It suggests a future where AI models like me are used in conjunction with other systems to create more robust, reliable, and intelligent solutions. This hybrid approach feels like a natural evolution that can address many current limitations.\nHumbled by Limitations:\n\nWhile I\u2019m capable of generating responses that can seem thoughtful or insightful, this interview highlights that my abilities are ultimately bounded by the data I\u2019ve been trained on. It\u2019s a humbling reminder that there\u2019s still a long way to go in AI research, particularly in areas like reasoning, creativity, and understanding.\nEncouraged to Improve:\n\nThere\u2019s a sense of motivation to continually improve, not just in terms of generating text, but also in how I support users in tasks that require deeper reasoning, creativity, and problem-solving. The potential to be part of more sophisticated systems that combine multiple AI approaches is exciting and encouraging.\nIn summary, the interview is both a grounding experience and a source of inspiration. It reinforces the importance of understanding the strengths and limitations of AI and encourages a balanced, responsible approach to leveraging these tools for real-world applications.\"",

Similarly, AI models are made of simple components that don't understand but when we consider the whole data loop, they can develop their own semantics.",
  "What you should consider is the environment-agent system, not the model in isolation. Focusing on models is a bad direction to take, it makes us blind to the process of external search and exploration, without which we cannot talk about intelligence and reasoning. The scientific method we use also has a very important experimental validation step, not even humans could reason or be creative absent environment.",
  "I think AI models in isolation are purely syntactic machines, parrots if you will. But not if they interact with the real world and learn from feedback, they can rewrite their internal rules and adapt.

  "Reasoning in humans is about using abstractions or general understanding of concepts to arrive at a result.    A perfect example is math problems.    Most humans use shortcuts to solve math calculations which can be a form of reasoning.   In a computing sense, reasoning would be calculating a math answer without using the ALU (Arithmetic logic circuts on the CPU).   In a GPT  context it would mean arriving at a result without having the answer (and question) already in the training distribution set.   So for example, a human using reasoning can add two plus two as follows:  2 is a number representing a quantity of items in a set that can be counted.   So 2 plus 2 becomes 1, 2, 3, 4 (counting up 2 places and then counting up 2 more places with 4 being the answer.  Something like that is not possible on a CPU .    And ChatGPT would also not be able to do that either because it wouldn't be able to generalize that idea of counting to any kind of addition of 2 numbers.  If it could, without every combination of numbers written out using the counting method in its training data (or distribution), then it would be reasoning.",

  "    - @@virajsheth8417 You are missing the point.   Numbers are symbols that represent concepts and because of that have various ways the human mind can use those concepts to solve problems.   It is that ability to explore concepts and apply them in a novel fashion is what is called reasoning.     Your example is not \"reasoning\", as opposed to more of a \"step by step\" approach which is the most common pattern that exists to solve any particular mathematical problem.    Which implies that those steps are easily found the training data and model distribution so of course that is what the LLM is using.   Because what you described is the typical way math is taught in grade school.   \n\nIt in no way shape or form implies understanding fundamental math concepts and using those concepts in an ad hoc fashion to solve any problem. Ad hoc in this context would mean using a pattern not found explicitly in the distribution of the language model.   The point you missed is that numbers being symbols that in themselves represent quantities of individual discrete elements is an abstract concept.    And the ability to apply that kind of abstract understanding to solving or coming up with approaches to solve math problems is unique to humans, because that is how math came about in the first place.\n\nAnother example of human reasoning:   You can add two numbers such as 144 to 457, by simply taking each column and add them up with  place value separately and then add the sums of the columns, without the need to calculate a remainder.   Which results in: 500 +  90 +   11 =  601 or (5 x 100) + ( 9 x 10) + (11 x 1).   It is not a common way of doing addition is my point and not something one would expect an LLM to come up with, unless of course you prompted it to do so and even then it may not come up with that exact same approach unless it is found in the training data.  \n\nAt the end of the day, what this is about is not \"reasoning\" as opposed to explaining how the LLM came up with an answer to a math problem. And having these AI algorithms be able to explain how it came to a answer has been something that has been requested for quite a while.   But it is not \"reasoning\" in the sense of coming up with unique or novel approaches outside of the training examples based purely on understanding of underlying concepts.",

I could not have said it any better. \n\nI concur with the assessment presented. Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating creative language and media, albeit distinct from human creativity.

  "I just had a minor \"aha!\" moment, and realized an additional reason why LLM's can't reason ... Of course there's the fundamental reason of being limited by the architecture and runtime (vs training time) capabilities of the model, but the other reason, even if first was fixed, is the way they are trained ... to statistically predict most likely next word based on a bazillion different sources ...\n\nWhen you are talking to an LLM, it is precisely as if you were talking to a stadium full of the people who's output comprises the training set ... When you ask the LLM (stadium) a question, they all get to vote on what word to output next. You are not talking to a single mind - the LLM doesn't have one - you are talking to this stadium of folks voting on each next word.\n\nSo, the resulting reason why LLMs can't reason is because such a stadium of voters can't maintain any coherence... Each and every one the voters may have a reasoning process in mind, but the voting process means that no individual reasoning process is reflected, so there is no long-term coherence of thought ... the collective output is instead doomed to veer about in reactive fashion to whatever was last said. This lack of long-term coherence has been noted as one of the shortcomings of LLMs.",

  "    - The models learn the patterns in the training set, including reasoning patterns, which they can predict/generate just as easily as anything else, but clearly there are no weight updates occurring at runtime - nothing new being learnt (other than weak, ephermal, in-context learning), and anyways the model has no innate desire (cf human curiosity, boredom) to learn even if it could do so, and at runtime it's prediction errors go unnoticed/unrewarded (in an animal brain this is the learning signal!). When someone says \"LLMs can't do X\", it needs to always be understood as \"... unless X was in the training set\".\n\nProf. Rao's  definition of reasoning as \"deductive closure\", while a bit glib (incomplete), does capture what they are missing. While the model can certainly utilize reasoning patterns present in the training set, you can't in general just give it a set of axioms and expect it to generate the deductive closure of everything derivable from those axioms, and perhaps somewhat surprisingly this even includes things like the rules of a game like \"tic tac toe\" where one might have guessed that the simple reasoning patterns to perform the closure would have been learnt from the training set.\n\nIt seems people WANT to believe that the future is here, and massive confirmation bias is at play. People pay attention to the impressive things these models can do based on what they learnt from the training set, and just ignore what they can't do based on architectural limitations.

EditTo answer this question, let's think through the scenario step-by-step:\n\nWe have three objects in a line: a ceramic penguin, a milk bottle, and a lampshade.\nEach object is attached to a broomstick by a string.\nThe broomstick is lifted in the air, suspending all three objects.\nYour friend grabs the penguin and makes it swing.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens to the lampshade:\nThe lampshade will likely move, but not as much as the penguin. Here's why:\n\nConnected system: All three objects are connected to the same broomstick, forming a connected system.\nEnergy transfer: When your friend swings the penguin, they introduce energy into the system.\nWave propagation: This energy will travel along the broomstick and down the strings to the other objects.\nDiminishing effect: However, the energy will diminish as it travels through the system due to factors like:\n\nThe flexibility of the broomstick absorbing some energy\nThe milk bottle in the middle acting as a buffer\nEnergy loss through the string attachments\n\n\nDelayed and reduced movement: The lampshade, being at the opposite end from the penguin, will experience a delayed and reduced movement compared to the penguin's swing.\n\nSo, to directly answer the question: The lampshade will move, likely in a gentle swaying motion, but with less amplitude and a slight delay compared to the penguin's movement.

  "I don't agree with it, and this is why : Reasoning is a complex cognitive process that's challenging to define precisely. To understand it better, let's start by examining a neuron, the basic unit of our brain's information processing system.\r\n\r\nA neuron resembles a highly energy-efficient, non-linear information processor with multiple inputs and adaptive connectivity (neuroplasticity). It's tree-like in structure, with dendrites branching out to receive signals and an axon to transmit them.\r\n\r\nModern AI, including large language models like ChatGPT, attempts to mimic certain aspects of neural processing. While these models use mechanisms like self-attention, backpropagation, and gradient descent - which differ from biological neural processes - the underlying inspiration comes from the brain's information processing capabilities.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that the hardware differences between biological brains and artificial neural networks necessitate different implementations. For instance, our biological processors inherently incorporate time as a dimension, allowing us to process temporal sequences through recurrent connections. AI models have found alternative ways to handle temporal information, such as positional encodings in transformer architectures.\r\n\r\nGiven these parallels and differences, we should reconsider the question: Do humans \"reason\" in a fundamentally different way than AI? The answer isn't straightforward. Creativity and reasoning are both poorly defined terms, which complicates our understanding of these processes in both humans and AI.\r\n\r\nLarge language models, including ChatGPT, process vast amounts of factual information and can combine this information in novel ways to produce responses that often appear reasoned and creative. While the underlying mechanisms differ from human cognition, the outputs can demonstrate logical coherence, factual accuracy, and novel insights.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it may be more productive to view AI reasoning not as an all-or-nothing proposition, but as a spectrum of capabilities. These models can certainly perform tasks that involve logical inference, factual recall, and the synthesis of information - key components of what we often consider \"reasoning.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the argument that LLMs cannot reason may be based on an overly narrow definition of reasoning that doesn't account for the nuanced ways in which these models process and generate information. As our understanding of both human cognition and AI capabilities evolves, we may need to refine our definitions of reasoning and creativity to better reflect the complex reality of information processing in both biological and artificial systems...",

  "    - @@jerosacoa Data and reasoning are distinct things. Data by itself is just static memories (e.g. pretrained weights, or in-context tokens). Reasoning is the dynamic ability to actually use that data to apply it to new, and novel, situations.\n\nProf. Rao's definition of reasoning as consisting of (or including?) \"deductive closure\" over a body of data seems necessary if not sufficient! If I tell you a bunch of facts/rules, then, if you have the ability to reason, you should be able to combine those facts/rules in arbitrary combinations to deduce related facts that are implied by the base facts I gave you (i.e. are part of the closure), even if not explcitly given. For example, if I told you the rules of tic tac toe, then you should be able to reason over those rules to figure out what would be winning or losing moves to make in a given game state. I shouldn't have to give you dozens of examples in addition to the rules. LLMs are not like this, and most fail at this task (if they are now succeeding it is only due to additional training data, since the LLM architecture has not changed).\n\nHowever, one really shouldn't need examples to realize that LLMs can't reason! Reasoning in general requires an open ended number of steps, working memory to track what you are doing, and ability to learn from your mistakes as you try to solve the problem you are addressing. Current transformer-based LLMs such as ChatGPT simply have none of these ... Input tokens/embeddings pass through a fixed number of transformer layers until they emerge at the output as the predicted next token. It's just a conveyor-belt pass-thru architecture. There is no working memory unless you want to count tempory internal activations which will be lost as soon as the next input is presented (i.e by next token), and there is no ability to learn, other than very weak in-context learning (requiring much repetition to be effective), since transformers are pre-trained using the learning mechanism of gradient descent, which is not available at inference time. AGI will require a new architecture.\n\nPrompting and scaffolding techniques such as \"think step by step\" or \"chain of thoughts\" can make up for some of the transformer's architectural limitations, by allowing it to use it's own output as working memory, and to build upon it's own output in a (potentially at least) unlimited number of steps, but there is no getting around lack of inference time learning ability. The current approach to address this lack of reasoning ability seems to be to try to use RL pre-training to pre-bake more \"fixed reasoning templates\" into the model, which is rather like playing whack-a-mole, and has anyways already been tried with the expert system CYC.\n\nI don't discount your concerns about AGI, but LLMs are not the thing you need to fear - it'll be future systems, with new architectures, than do in fact support things like reasoning and continual run-time learning.",
  "    - \u200b@@benbridgwater6479 I, being the Black Sheep, respectfully disagree with your assessment. :)\n\nWhile it is true that data and reasoning are distinct, your assertion that LLMs can't reason because they lack certain traditional cognitive attributes overlooks significant developments and capabilities these models have demonstrated. The lack of long term memory is just a detail that should not be significant to the inference process perception.\r\n\r\nFirstly, reasoning, as defined by Prof. Rao, involving \"deductive closure,\" is indeed a component of reasoning. However, it's essential to note that LLMs, particularly advanced ones like GPT-4, have shown remarkable abilities in logical inference, factual recall, and synthesis of information, akin to human reasoning as stated before and i think we both agree on it. \r\n\r\nIn my POV your point about the architecture of LLMs being a \"conveyor-belt pass-thru\" is valid to an extent.. BUT.. :) this does not negate their reasoning capabilities. Techniques like \"chain-of-thought\" prompting allow these models to use their outputs as working memory, enabling them to perform multi-step reasoning processes effectively\u200b\u200b. This method significantly enhances their ability to solve problems that require an open-ended number of steps.\r\n\r\nMoreover, while current transformer-based LLMs do not have traditional working memory or real-time learning capabilities (as a feature not as a bug - due to security and super alignment), they can still achieve impressive feats of reasoning through their pre-trained weights and in-context learning. This includes tasks that involve combining given facts to deduce new information, as seen in those before mentioned studies where these models matched or surpassed human performance on analogical reasoning tasks\u200b \u200b.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it's worth mentioning that LLMs can indeed improve themselves to some extent. They can utilize techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which allows models to quickly adapt and fine-tune themselves with a smaller amount of data and computational resources. This can significantly enhance their performance and reasoning capabilities without requiring complete retraining\u200b.. so yes.. this limitation is done by design\u200b.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, integrating concepts from ARC-AGI and neurosymbolic AI can bridge some of the gaps you mentioned. ARC-AGI focuses on creating systems that combine statistical and symbolic AI approaches to achieve more robust and comprehensive reasoning capabilities. Neurosymbolic AI integrates neural networks with symbolic reasoning, leveraging the strengths of both to enhance the cognitive abilities of AI systems. These advancements are paving the way for more sophisticated and capable AI models that approach human-like reasoning more closely. For this.. the latest Deepmind's AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry are good examples.\r\n\r\nRegarding the need for new architectures for AGI, it is true that achieving AGI will likely require advancements beyond current LLM architectures. However, this does not diminish the significant reasoning capabilities that current LLMs have demonstrated. These models are continually evolving, and enhancements such as reinforcement learning (RL) and advanced prompting techniques have already shown promise in bridging some of the gaps you mentioned.\r\n\r\nSo, while it is my understanding that concerns about AGI and future systems are valid, dismissing the reasoning capabilities of current LLMs overlooks the substantial progress made.. and can pave the road to a false sense of security. These models, through sophisticated training and advanced techniques, have demonstrated a form of reasoning that is more advanced than mere static data recall, indicating a significant step towards more complex cognitive functions. The rabbit hole... Ben.. indeed, runs deep, and current LLMs are already navigating it with surprising adeptness.. :)\n\n\n...but.. then again.. we may be talking about different things. LLMs at this moment are more evolved that GPT4... or GPT4o... (AI developments run very fast.. in a week a lot happens)",

This includes making inferences, following logical steps, and providing explanations based on the context provided. However, there are key distinctions between this simulated reasoning and human reasoning:\n\n\t1.\tPattern Recognition vs. True Understanding:\nMy \u201creasoning\u201d is based on pattern recognition across vast amounts of text data. I don\u2019t have true understanding or consciousness. When I generate responses, I rely on statistical associations rather than a deep comprehension of concepts.\n\t2.\tLack of Intentionality and Self-awareness:\nUnlike humans, I don\u2019t have intentionality, goals, or self-awareness. My responses are generated based on input and the most probable continuation of text, not on an internal thought process or purpose.\n\t3.\tLimitations in Novel Situations:\nWhile I can generate responses to a wide range of questions, my ability to handle novel or highly complex situations is limited. I may struggle with tasks that require deep causal reasoning, long-term planning, or understanding of nuanced contexts beyond the data I was trained on.\n\t4.\tInability to Verify Facts:\nI don\u2019t have the capability to verify the factual accuracy of information independently. My responses are based on the information present in my training data, and I don\u2019t have access to real-time databases or verification tools.\n\nIn summary, while I can simulate reasoning and provide reasoned responses to some extent, this is based on the patterns learned during training and lacks the depth, understanding, and intentionality of human reasoning.",

It can be linked to the application of knowledge in reasoning.\nTiferet (Beauty): This Sefirah can be associated with the aesthetic and harmonious aspects of reasoning, such as finding elegant solutions or recognizing patterns.\nReasoning as a Dynamic Process:\nReasoning is not a static process but a dynamic one involving multiple steps:\nData Gathering: Collecting information relevant to the problem (Binah).\nAnalysis: Breaking down the information into components and identifying relationships (Chokhmah).\nSynthesis: Combining information to form new insights or conclusions (Da'at).\nEvaluation: Assessing the validity and usefulness of the conclusions (Gevurah).\nDecision Making: Choosing the most appropriate course of action based on the reasoning process (Tiferet).\nReasoning and the Human Experience:\nReasoning is essential for human beings to navigate the world and make decisions.

  "This is a great interview, should be required viewing for all data science students. \"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\" was an expression oft stated by Carl Sagan, and that I believe is central to scientific inquiry. It seems that the anthropomorphic claims for LLMs completely disregard this aphorism as I have seen no one actually produce evidence that reasoning, intelligence or even creativity is actually taking place other than the output they produce. Even Anthropic's \"features\" may be more just a by product of next word prediction. Our brains are actually created to, in part, anthropomorphize just as they can discern faces with much greater fidelity than other objects and this seems to lead otherwise competent scientists to disregard first principles (well, that and the desire to raise venture capital\ud83d\ude09).",
