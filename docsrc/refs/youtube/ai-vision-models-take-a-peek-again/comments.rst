  "Thank you, Matt.  You're definitely the most dashing and handsome Matt.  To give you an n of 1 for researching your audience, here's what I'm looking for when I view AI channels on YouTube:  1. Information that I can employ immediately or within a very short time frame, preferably no cash outlay.  2. Something I can employ locally on extremely low budget hardware.  I scraped enough money together for a used i7 desktop with 32 gigs of RAM, 2 gig NVIDIA card (not useful).  With this, the non vision 3.2 Llama on Ollama works in Docker on Ubuntu.  An M1 Mac is a pipe dream for me, so information on hardware like that or better is not applicable to me in particular.  3. The very latest information, and that's why I look for Matt Berman's new releases each day.  4. Information that is accessible to a non-programmer, meaning information not in programmer jargon-y language.  5.  Information that's going to improve my life or help boost my income (but no \"Make $5,000 per day with AI\" bull$#|^\").  5.  Something new and interesting, something I haven't heard of or thought of.    (End of list)   To be honest, I don't really like to sit through tests of the models, so I skip to recap at the end of test videos.  I would much rather have brief bullet points of what a model can do compared to others and then get right to using it.  Also, please consider a summary video short for each video you do.  I'd love those and would watch both.  What really draws me is something novel that a model can do.  I deeply appreciate that you're here to educate us.  Also, thanks for your role in creating Ollama.  That's power to the people, especially cash-strapped people like me.",

Then the second part is I asked the LLM to return JSON representing the  chunking of the data breaking it up not by word count but by meaning to see if that would do better than chunking by size with overlap. \nAnyways it went well on this small POC just curious about your thoughts on this type of process.
