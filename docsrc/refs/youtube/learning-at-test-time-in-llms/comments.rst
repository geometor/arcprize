  "I love the program, not the editing of the video at all; why do you keep switching back to the picture of the merely mildly gesticulating ape all the time, when all the data is on the slide, which you barely keep up long enough to read? What info do you imagine that picture of a human standing is transmitting?",
  "Wow, the time stamps with info are really helpful.",
  "Does that mean it can be unrelated and non-redundant data for local training? It\u2019s hard to see how that can help with inference. If not then, are you not imposing an inductive prior by your selection of data? And your bet effectively becomes the inductive prior.",
  "Superb presentation but it would be better to show the slides while the presenter is talking may be as a separate window.",
  "    - Do agree, we need the slides,  we don\u2019t need to watch the guy. Or maybe putting the guy on a reduced window on a corner would be better",
  "Local and Context based Learning is one area where more and more people should work. It may solve the huge energy-need problem to run LLMs and can have various applications from Query Retrieval in DBMS to Edge Learning devices.",
  "Historically, betting against technology advancement, just you couldnt imaging how exactly it could work, was always a bad idea",
  "I can't concentrate on what this dude is saying because he's so annoyingly handsome, jesus christ.",
  "This is connected to the power consumption of AGI. Scaling laws of progress will be based on electricity flowing through systems.  Limited power is the main factor now",
  "two serious problems for this paper 1. how do you know using embedding Nearest Neighbors can find the nearest data for training , embedding is not the right measurement especially for complex multiple dimensional similarity requirement  2. what's the business application scenarios ,  this is method is complicated and most of business application has pretty stabilized tasks , why I need to hold a huge distributed index for highly flexible tasks ? \n\nI do not see much high potential from this paper .",
  "When he says that the learned information becomes part of its beliefs, technically how does that work? \nI\u2019m really stuck on how providing new data \u201cgets into\u201d the model.",

  "Is the answer to solve extrapolation and generalisation, interpolate bettter? Seems like this will get us to GenAI saturation faster, not take us beyond?",
  "    - not about extrapolation / interpolation, so much about local vs global",
  "    - @MachineLearningStreetTalk\u00a0 local manifold interpolation rather than global manifold interpolation? I think I must be missing something?",
  "How much is it really about just teaching what it needs to know at the last minute so that it can perform well on the expected question? Are we not simply engineering an answer given that if the local training is done on unrelated data then the result will be less good.",
  "For me the presentation had too much jargons that it was difficult to follow and understand.",
  "It's not going to be easy to aggregate multiple queries into a batch and run inference with this technique. The TTT would need different fine tuning data for each query. It might be very good for small models running on personal  desktop machines.",
  "There is no wall",
  "Yesss I was waiting for this. Specifically looked for it in the channel last night and realized the paper only came out a week ago",
  "It's konda hard to follow when we don't see what he's talking about. Show the slides instead of the presenter. \ud83d\ude4f",
  "Wow.. what a discovery!  Self bootstrapping representations based on data selection at test time to boost information gain.  This will be major for model based RL!",
  "A very keen and interested young man that clearly expressed his passion at  providing a solution. I really hope he continues to express willingness to share his thoughts and beliefs with others and that he fulfills the potential that he shows so fluently.",
  "Working on ARC, Francois gave us some hints about this approach in his University tour. Now he's left Google to work on ....? Something that we learned in ARC-AGI Challenge we hope!!!",
  "editing is ridiculously bad",
  "    - Yeah.. they really needed to cut to the equations when he was referring to them.  A bit if highlighting wouldn't go astray either.",

  "    - @ ai isn\u2019t thinking or doing anything with knowledge, it\u2019s closer to a search.  So all the comparisons of consciousness are because of this projection we put onto it.  You would never think the internet or a computer is conscious, but for some reason we spend a lot of effort and time discussing how evil AI could be once it\u2019s smart enough.  Also the design of the products and uses are limited by this human like role we put onto ai.",
  "Machine learning used to be about maths. Now it is about hardware, hype, opinions, and moving big software blocks around. A generation has come into being that lacks the basic ability to make the kinds of jumps in theory made in the 1980s and 1990s.",
  "    - OK boomer",
