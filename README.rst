This project is a collection of studies inspired by the Abstraction and
Reasoning Corpus (ARC) - a set of puzzles designed to be easy for humans
to solve - but difficult for AI. 

The ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) challenge presents a fundamental test
of machine intelligence through pattern recognition and reasoning. This project
provides a systematic approach to analyzing and solving ARC puzzles, with a focus
on geometric patterns and transformations.


For more information on ARC and the current contest, check out https://arcprize.org

began my journey with ARC think that I it might be fun to build a system 

realized the intention in `On the Measure of Intelligence`_ is for an agent to address the puzzles with
no previous knowledge about the puzzles

if I were to design a system (if I could) then I would be demonstrating my
intelligence

So, the question becomes: can a machine properly ingest a puzzle in a way that
it is understood

.. _On the Measure of Intelligence: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.01547



mission
-------

We are guided by several important questions


- **Can an LLM solve an ARC puzzle?**

  We know the answer is yes, but can it solve any puzzle.

- **Can an LLM perceive the elements of the puzzle?**



- **Can an LLM discern the "story" of the puzzle?**


mission
-------

- build a system to facilitate the participation by an LLM 
- Focus on extracting a natural language program for 

priors
------

to successsfully tell the story, an intelligent system would need to be able to
perceive and discern the following:


    - Objectness

      Objects persist and cannot appear or disappear without reason. Objects can interact or not depending on the circumstances.

    - Goal-directedness

      Objects can be animate or inanimate. Some objects are "agents" - they have intentions and they pursue goals.

    - Numbers & counting

      Objects can be counted or sorted by their shape, appearance, or movement using basic mathematics like addition, subtraction, and comparison.

    - Basic geometry & topology

      Objects can be shapes like rectangles, triangles, and circles which can be
      mirrored, rotated, translated, deformed, combined, repeated, etc.
      Differences in distances can be detected.

Project Philosophy
----------------

This project approaches the ARC challenge through the lens of fundamental geometric
principles and pattern recognition. Rather than treating each puzzle as an isolated
problem, we seek to understand the underlying patterns and transformations that
connect them.

Key principles:

- Focus on basic perception before complex reasoning
- Systematic documentation of observations
- Integration of geometric analysis
- Progressive refinement of solution strategies
