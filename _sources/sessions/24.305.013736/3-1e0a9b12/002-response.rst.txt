differences:
  cells_changed: 2
  colors_changed: maroon moved from top right to bottom right. One azure has appeared bottom left
transformation:
  - maroon moves from top right to bottom right
  - azure appears on the bottom row as well.
  - seems as though the non-zero pixels again, "fall" to the bottom row and shift to the left


Ruminations:
It appears the transformation shifts all non-zero color pixels down to the last row.  They then shift left, ordered by their first appearance scanning top to bottom, left to right. Zeros are added to vacant cells.
