**Test Input Observations:**

```text
input:
  width: 3
  height: 3
  colors:
    - 1: (3) blue
    - 3: (3) green
    - 8: (3) azure
  objects:
    - 3 columns of single color pixels repeating across rows
```

The test input follows the same structure as the training examples.  It has the same dimensions and exhibits the same pattern of repeated colors in columns.

Now we need to predict the output. Based on the examples, we know the output will likely maintain the 3x3 dimensions and the column-wise transformation pattern. However, the specific operations applied to each column remain to be determined.  Since there isn't a single, consistent transformation rule across all examples, we can't directly apply any previously observed rule to the test input.

Let's proceed to apply transformations to the test input grid, column by column, and review the results.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input.
