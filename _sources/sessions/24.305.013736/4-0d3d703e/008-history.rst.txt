Based on the examples, the transformation rules seem to be applied column-wise and might involve addition or subtraction of a constant value to all the cells in a column.  It doesn't seem like there is a fixed single rule across all examples. Each example appears to have unique column transformations. The height and width of the output grid remains the same as the input grid.  Ready to proceed to rumination phase.

**examples summary**

**Rumination Phase:**

The core observation is that transformations are applied column-wise.  We need to determine the specific mathematical operation (addition or subtraction) and the constant value used for each column. The examples suggest the output color is always derived from the input color in the same column, but the specific transformation varies.

Let's analyze the changes more systematically using `numpy` to hopefully identify a pattern:

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    
    examples = {
        1: (np.array([[3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2]]), np.array([[4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6]])),
        2: (np.array([[2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8]]), np.array([[6, 4, 9], [6, 4, 9], [6, 4, 9]])),
        3: (np.array([[5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6]]), np.array([[1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2]])),
        4: (np.array([[9, 4, 2], [9, 4, 2], [9, 4, 2]]), np.array([[8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6]])),
    }
    
    for i in range(1,5):
      input_grid, output_grid = examples[i]
      diff = output_grid - input_grid
      print(f"Example {i}: Difference matrix:\n{diff}")

code_execution_result: 1

```
Example 1: Difference matrix:
[[1 4 4]
 [1 4 4]
 [1 4 4]]
Example 2: Difference matrix:
[[4 1 1]
 [4 1 1]
 [4 1 1]]
Example 3: Difference matrix:
[[-4  1 -4]
 [-4  1 -4]
 [-4  1 -4]]
Example 4: Difference matrix:
[[-1 -1  4]
 [-1 -1  4]
 [-1 -1  4]]

```

The difference matrices confirm the column-wise nature of the transformations.  Each column has a constant difference between the input and output.  This confirms our initial hypothesis about the transformations. I'm now ready for the test input.

**test**

**input**


.. code-block::

    [[8 1 3]
     [8 1 3]
     [8 1 3]]

**observations:**

**Test Input Observations:**

```text
input:
  width: 3
  height: 3
  colors:
    - 1: (3) blue
    - 3: (3) green
    - 8: (3) azure
  objects:
    - 3 columns of single color pixels repeating across rows
```

The test input follows the same structure as the training examples.  It has the same dimensions and exhibits the same pattern of repeated colors in columns.

Now we need to predict the output. Based on the examples, we know the output will likely maintain the 3x3 dimensions and the column-wise transformation pattern. However, the specific operations applied to each column remain to be determined.  Since there isn't a single, consistent transformation rule across all examples, we can't directly apply any previously observed rule to the test input.

Let's proceed to apply transformations to the test input grid, column by column, and review the results.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input.

**initialize the working output grid:**

function_call:

initialize_output_from_input

result:

initialize_output_from_input()

- take a moment to review that the changes in the working output grid are in keeping with the rule

- use code_execution to investigate properties
