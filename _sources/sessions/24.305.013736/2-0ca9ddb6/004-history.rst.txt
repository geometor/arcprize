  - another plus sign in orange (7) is drawn centered on each blue (1) pixel
```
The transformation observed in the first example holds true in the second example as well.  There are two 1s and two 2s in the second example input, and plus signs of 7 and 4 respectively are drawn around each of them in the output. Also, pixels that are 8 remain unchanged.

  - another plus sign in orange (7) is drawn centered on each blue (1) pixel
  - pixels that are 6 remain the same.
```
The transformation observed in the first and second examples holds true in the third example as well. There is one blue (1) pixel and one red (2) pixel. Plus signs of orange (7) and yellow (4) are drawn around each of them, respectively, in the output. Also, pixels that are 6 remain unchanged.

**examples summary**

- summarize your observations to explain the transformation of the input to output

- use code_execution to investigate properties, patterns and differences in the grids
