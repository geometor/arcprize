Here's my analysis of the provided example:

**example_1**

**input:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 5
objects:
  - two objects composed of azure(8) pixels
    - object 1: size 3, top-left at (1,1)
    - object 2: size 2, top-left at (4,3)
```

**output:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 41
  - 8: 5
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - two azure(8) objects remain unchanged
  - two new blue(1) pixels:
    - at (2,1) to the right of the top-left pixel of object 1
    - at (4,4) above the bottom-right pixel of object 2
```

**differences:**
```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed:
    - two white(0) cells changed to blue(1)
```

**transformation:**
```
It seems a new blue(1) pixel is added next to the corner of each azure(8) object.  
For object 1 (shaped like a small triangle) the new pixel is added to the right of the top-left pixel.
For object 2 (shaped like a small square), the new pixel is placed above the bottom-right corner.
The exact rules for placement of the new pixels are not yet clear.  We might need to investigate different object shapes to better understand the logic.  It is possible the position could be relative to the top-most then left-most pixel, then selecting one adjacent empty cell.
```
