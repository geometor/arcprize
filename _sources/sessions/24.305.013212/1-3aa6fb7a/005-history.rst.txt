**observations**

Here's my analysis of the provided example:

**example_1**

**input:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 5
objects:
  - two objects composed of azure(8) pixels
    - object 1: size 3, top-left at (1,1)
    - object 2: size 2, top-left at (4,3)
```

**output:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 41
  - 8: 5
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - two azure(8) objects remain unchanged
  - two new blue(1) pixels:
    - at (2,1) to the right of the top-left pixel of object 1
    - at (4,4) above the bottom-right pixel of object 2
```

**differences:**
```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed:
    - two white(0) cells changed to blue(1)
```

**transformation:**
```
It seems a new blue(1) pixel is added next to the corner of each azure(8) object.  
For object 1 (shaped like a small triangle) the new pixel is added to the right of the top-left pixel.
For object 2 (shaped like a small square), the new pixel is placed above the bottom-right corner.
The exact rules for placement of the new pixels are not yet clear.  We might need to investigate different object shapes to better understand the logic.  It is possible the position could be relative to the top-most then left-most pixel, then selecting one adjacent empty cell.
```

**observations**

**example_2**

**input:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 5
objects:
  - three objects composed of azure(8) pixels
    - object 1: size 2, top-left at (4,0)
    - object 2: size 3, top-left at (2,2) rotated 90deg ccw
    - object 3: size 2, top-left at (3,5)
```

**output:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 40
  - 8: 5
  - 1: 3
objects:
  - the azure(8) objects remain unchanged
  - three new blue(1) pixels have been added
    - at (4,1)
    - at (3,2)
    - at (3,5)
```

**differences:**
```
cells_changed: 3
colors_changed:
    - three white(0) cells changed to blue(1)
```

**transformation:**
```
Again, it appears blue(1) pixels are added adjacent to each azure(8) object.
The first object adds the blue(1) below the top-right pixel.
The second adds blue(1) to the left of the top pixel.
The third adds blue(1) to the left of the top pixel.

This example confirms the new blue(1) pixels are placed adjacent to the top-most, then left-most azure(8) pixels within each distinct object.  However the choice of side (top, left, bottom, right) seems arbitrary at this point.
```

**examples summary**

**Examples Summary**

The transformation observed in both examples involves adding blue(1) pixels adjacent to existing azure(8) objects in the input grid.  Each distinct azure(8) object gets exactly one new blue(1) pixel.

The location of the new pixel seems to be near to the top-left most point of each object, although the precise side (up, down, left or right) where the blue(1) is placed remains unclear.  It seems likely that adjacency to another azure(8) pixel may influence which position is chosen for the new blue(1).

Let's use `numpy` to analyze pixel neighborhood relations and gather more data to clarify the side-choosing behavior.

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    
    def analyze_neighbors(grid, color):
        """Analyzes the neighbors of pixels with the given color in the grid."""
        neighbors = []
        height, width = grid.shape
        for y in range(height):
            for x in range(width):
                if grid[y, x] == color:
                    n = []
                    if y > 0 and grid[y - 1, x] != 0: n.append('u')
                    if y < height - 1 and grid[y + 1, x] != 0: n.append('d')
                    if x > 0 and grid[y, x - 1] != 0: n.append('l')
                    if x < width - 1 and grid[y, x + 1] != 0: n.append('r')
                    neighbors.append(((y,x), "".join(sorted(n))))
        return neighbors
    
    # Example 1 input
    grid1_in = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    
    # Example 2 input
    grid2_in = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                        [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])
    
    
    print(f'Example 1 neighbors: {analyze_neighbors(grid1_in, 8)}')
    print(f'Example 2 neighbors: {analyze_neighbors(grid2_in, 8)}')

code_execution_result: 1

```
Example 1 neighbors: [((1, 1), 'd'), ((2, 1), 'ru'), ((2, 2), 'l'), ((3, 4), 'r'), ((3, 5), 'dl'), ((4, 5), 'u')]
Example 2 neighbors: [((0, 4), 'r'), ((0, 5), 'dl'), ((1, 5), 'u'), ((2, 2), 'd'), ((3, 2), 'ru'), ((3, 3), 'l'), ((5, 4), 'd'), ((6, 3), 'r'), ((6, 4), 'lu')]

```

The neighbor analysis provides the location of each azure(8) pixel and directions to non-zero neighbors.  It confirms my suspicion about adjacency playing a role in placement of the new blue(1) pixels.  It appears the placement choice may simply fill in an available cell next to the top-left pixel of the object, with a preference for down if available, then right, then up, then left.  This might best be described as a clockwise spiral outwards from the top-left pixel, stopping at the first available empty cell.

                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                         [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    
    print(f'Test Input neighbors: {analyze_neighbors(grid_test, 8)}')

code_execution_result: 1

```
Test Input neighbors: [((0, 5), 'r'), ((0, 6), 'dl'), ((1, 0), 'dr'), ((1, 1), 'l'), ((1, 6), 'u'), ((2, 0), 'u'), ((3, 3), 'd'), ((4, 3), 'ru'), ((4, 4), 'l'), ((5, 1), 'd'), ((6, 0), 'r'), ((6, 1), 'lu')]

```

Based on the observed pattern, I predict the output will have four new blue(1) pixels at the following locations:

- Object 1: (0, 5) has a right neighbor so (0,4) gets a blue(1) since down is not available
- Object 2: (1, 0) has down and right. down is preferred so (2,0) gets a blue(1)
- Object 3: (3,3) has only down so (4,3) gets blue(1)
- Object 4: (6,0) has only right so (6,1) gets blue(1) since down is not available


I will now initialize the output grid from the input grid and proceed to set the predicted pixels to blue(1).

**initialize the working output grid:**

use function_call to initialize the working output grid:

- initialize_output_from_input: good when examples show few differences between input and output

- initialize_output_by_size: create a fresh grid from size and color
