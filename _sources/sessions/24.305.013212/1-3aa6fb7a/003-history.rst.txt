**observations**

Here's my analysis of the provided example:

**example_1**

**input:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 5
objects:
  - two objects composed of azure(8) pixels
    - object 1: size 3, top-left at (1,1)
    - object 2: size 2, top-left at (4,3)
```

**output:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 41
  - 8: 5
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - two azure(8) objects remain unchanged
  - two new blue(1) pixels:
    - at (2,1) to the right of the top-left pixel of object 1
    - at (4,4) above the bottom-right pixel of object 2
```

**differences:**
```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed:
    - two white(0) cells changed to blue(1)
```

**transformation:**
```
It seems a new blue(1) pixel is added next to the corner of each azure(8) object.  
For object 1 (shaped like a small triangle) the new pixel is added to the right of the top-left pixel.
For object 2 (shaped like a small square), the new pixel is placed above the bottom-right corner.
The exact rules for placement of the new pixels are not yet clear.  We might need to investigate different object shapes to better understand the logic.  It is possible the position could be relative to the top-most then left-most pixel, then selecting one adjacent empty cell.
```

**observations**

**example_2**

**input:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 5
objects:
  - three objects composed of azure(8) pixels
    - object 1: size 2, top-left at (4,0)
    - object 2: size 3, top-left at (2,2) rotated 90deg ccw
    - object 3: size 2, top-left at (3,5)
```

**output:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 40
  - 8: 5
  - 1: 3
objects:
  - the azure(8) objects remain unchanged
  - three new blue(1) pixels have been added
    - at (4,1)
    - at (3,2)
    - at (3,5)
```

**differences:**
```
cells_changed: 3
colors_changed:
    - three white(0) cells changed to blue(1)
```

**transformation:**
```
Again, it appears blue(1) pixels are added adjacent to each azure(8) object.
The first object adds the blue(1) below the top-right pixel.
The second adds blue(1) to the left of the top pixel.
The third adds blue(1) to the left of the top pixel.

This example confirms the new blue(1) pixels are placed adjacent to the top-most, then left-most azure(8) pixels within each distinct object.  However the choice of side (top, left, bottom, right) seems arbitrary at this point.
```

**examples summary**

- summarize your observations to explain the transformation of the input to output

- use code_execution to investigate properties, patterns and differences in the grids
