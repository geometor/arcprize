**Examples Summary**

The transformation observed in both examples involves adding blue(1) pixels adjacent to existing azure(8) objects in the input grid.  Each distinct azure(8) object gets exactly one new blue(1) pixel.

The location of the new pixel seems to be near to the top-left most point of each object, although the precise side (up, down, left or right) where the blue(1) is placed remains unclear.  It seems likely that adjacency to another azure(8) pixel may influence which position is chosen for the new blue(1).

Let's use `numpy` to analyze pixel neighborhood relations and gather more data to clarify the side-choosing behavior.

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    
    def analyze_neighbors(grid, color):
        """Analyzes the neighbors of pixels with the given color in the grid."""
        neighbors = []
        height, width = grid.shape
        for y in range(height):
            for x in range(width):
                if grid[y, x] == color:
                    n = []
                    if y > 0 and grid[y - 1, x] != 0: n.append('u')
                    if y < height - 1 and grid[y + 1, x] != 0: n.append('d')
                    if x > 0 and grid[y, x - 1] != 0: n.append('l')
                    if x < width - 1 and grid[y, x + 1] != 0: n.append('r')
                    neighbors.append(((y,x), "".join(sorted(n))))
        return neighbors
    
    # Example 1 input
    grid1_in = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    
    # Example 2 input
    grid2_in = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                        [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])
    
    
    print(f'Example 1 neighbors: {analyze_neighbors(grid1_in, 8)}')
    print(f'Example 2 neighbors: {analyze_neighbors(grid2_in, 8)}')

code_execution_result: 1

```
Example 1 neighbors: [((1, 1), 'd'), ((2, 1), 'ru'), ((2, 2), 'l'), ((3, 4), 'r'), ((3, 5), 'dl'), ((4, 5), 'u')]
Example 2 neighbors: [((0, 4), 'r'), ((0, 5), 'dl'), ((1, 5), 'u'), ((2, 2), 'd'), ((3, 2), 'ru'), ((3, 3), 'l'), ((5, 4), 'd'), ((6, 3), 'r'), ((6, 4), 'lu')]

```

The neighbor analysis provides the location of each azure(8) pixel and directions to non-zero neighbors.  It confirms my suspicion about adjacency playing a role in placement of the new blue(1) pixels.  It appears the placement choice may simply fill in an available cell next to the top-left pixel of the object, with a preference for down if available, then right, then up, then left.  This might best be described as a clockwise spiral outwards from the top-left pixel, stopping at the first available empty cell.
