**example_2**

**input:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 5
objects:
  - three objects composed of azure(8) pixels
    - object 1: size 2, top-left at (4,0)
    - object 2: size 3, top-left at (2,2) rotated 90deg ccw
    - object 3: size 2, top-left at (3,5)
```

**output:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 40
  - 8: 5
  - 1: 3
objects:
  - the azure(8) objects remain unchanged
  - three new blue(1) pixels have been added
    - at (4,1)
    - at (3,2)
    - at (3,5)
```

**differences:**
```
cells_changed: 3
colors_changed:
    - three white(0) cells changed to blue(1)
```

**transformation:**
```
Again, it appears blue(1) pixels are added adjacent to each azure(8) object.
The first object adds the blue(1) below the top-right pixel.
The second adds blue(1) to the left of the top pixel.
The third adds blue(1) to the left of the top pixel.

This example confirms the new blue(1) pixels are placed adjacent to the top-most, then left-most azure(8) pixels within each distinct object.  However the choice of side (top, left, bottom, right) seems arbitrary at this point.
