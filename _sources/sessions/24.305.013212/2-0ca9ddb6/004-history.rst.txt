**observations**

Here's a breakdown of the input and output grids, along with some observations:

**Example 1**

```
input:
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: 79
    - 1: 1
    - 2: 1
output:
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: 68
    - 1: 1
    - 2: 1
    - 4: 4
    - 7: 4
differences:
  cells_changed: 8
  colors_changed:
    - Four cells changed to yellow (4) around the red (2).
    - Four cells changed to orange (7) around the blue (1).
transformation:
  - It appears that a plus sign (+) of yellow is placed around the red pixel.
  - It appears that a plus sign (+) of orange is placed around the blue pixel.
```

  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: 77
    - 1: 2
    - 2: 2
    - 8: 1
output:

    - 2: 2
    - 4: 4
    - 7: 6
    - 8: 1
differences:
  cells_changed: 10
  colors_changed:
    - Four cells changed to yellow (4) around each of the two red (2) pixels.
    - Six cells changed to orange (7) around each of the two blue (1) pixels.
transformation:
  - Again, it appears that a plus sign (+) of yellow is placed around each red pixel.
  - Again, it appears that a plus sign (+) of orange is placed around each blue pixel.
  - The azure (8) pixel remains unchanged.

input:
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: 79
    - 1: 1
    - 2: 1
    - 6: 1
output:

    - 1: 1
    - 2: 1
    - 4: 4
    - 6: 1
    - 7: 4
differences:
  cells_changed: 8
  colors_changed:
    - Four cells changed to yellow (4) around the red (2).
    - Four cells changed to orange (7) around the blue (1).
transformation:
  - It appears that a plus sign (+) of yellow is placed around the red pixel.
  - It appears that a plus sign (+) of orange is placed around the blue pixel.
  - The magenta (6) pixel remains unchanged.
```

**Rumination Phase**

Based on the provided examples, it seems highly probable that the core transformation rule involves placing yellow (+) shapes around red pixels and orange (+) shapes around blue pixels. Other colors appear to remain unchanged.  I will use this as my primary hypothesis going into the test phase.

**examples summary**

- summarize your observations to explain the transformation of the input to output

- use code_execution to investigate properties, patterns and differences in the grids
