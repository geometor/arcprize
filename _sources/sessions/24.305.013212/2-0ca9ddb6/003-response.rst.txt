  colors_changed:
    - Four cells changed to yellow (4) around the red (2).
    - Four cells changed to orange (7) around the blue (1).
transformation:
  - It appears that a plus sign (+) of yellow is placed around the red pixel.
  - It appears that a plus sign (+) of orange is placed around the blue pixel.
  - The magenta (6) pixel remains unchanged.
```

**Rumination Phase**

Based on the provided examples, it seems highly probable that the core transformation rule involves placing yellow (+) shapes around red pixels and orange (+) shapes around blue pixels. Other colors appear to remain unchanged.  I will use this as my primary hypothesis going into the test phase.
