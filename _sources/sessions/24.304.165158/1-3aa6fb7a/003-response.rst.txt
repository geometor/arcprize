The transformation rule seems to involve adding blue (1) pixels adjacent to the cluster of azure (8) pixels.  The placement of the new blue pixels isn't perfectly consistent across the examples but generally follows a pattern expanding the cluster in a diagonal-like manner.  More examples are needed to precisely define this pattern. The number of blue pixels added seems to be loosely correlated with the number of external azure pixels.

To address the uncertainty in the placement of the blue pixels, a probabilistic approach could be implemented.  Each white pixel could be assigned a probability of becoming blue based on its adjacency to azure pixels.  A higher adjacency score would result in a higher probability of being changed. This approach would help address inconsistencies and unpredictable placements in the pattern.
