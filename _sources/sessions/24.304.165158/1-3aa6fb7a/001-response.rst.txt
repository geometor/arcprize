Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 6
objects:
  - a cluster of 8's (6 pixels) with a roughly triangular shape.
```

**Output:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 42
  - 8: 6
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - a cluster of 8's (6 pixels) with a roughly triangular shape.
  - two isolated 1's (blue pixels) near the 8's cluster.
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed: Two '1' (blue) pixels appeared where there were previously '0' (white) pixels.  The locations are adjacent to '8' (azure) pixels.
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve the addition of two blue pixels.  The location of these new blue pixels seems to be adjacent to the existing azure cluster, specifically on the right-hand side in a diagonal-like manner, adding one pixel diagonally down and one horizontally to the right of the main azure cluster.  More examples are needed to confirm if the placement rule is consistent and to determine if there are any conditions for this rule to apply.  The transformation doesn't seem to depend on the shape, size, or overall distribution of the azure cluster.

To better understand the rule, additional examples are needed.  These examples should vary the size and shape of the azure cluster, explore different placements, and assess whether there is a single point in the cluster from which the addition of blue pixels is made.
