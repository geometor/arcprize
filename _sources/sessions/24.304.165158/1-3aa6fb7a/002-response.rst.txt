**Example 2**

**Input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 7
objects:
  - a cluster of 8's (7 pixels) with an irregular shape.
```

**Output:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 40
  - 8: 7
  - 1: 3
objects:
  - a cluster of 8's (7 pixels) with an irregular shape.
  - three isolated 1's (blue pixels) near the 8's cluster.
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 3
colors_changed: Three '1' (blue) pixels appeared where there were previously '0' (white) pixels.  The placement of the new blue pixels shows a similar pattern to Example 1, each close to an 8 and generally in a diagonal-like manner relative to each other
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation is consistent with Example 1. It adds blue pixels (1's) adjacent to the existing azure pixels (8's).  The pattern isn't perfectly consistent but the addition of new blue pixels is around the perimeter of the main azure cluster. The exact placement appears to be dependent on spatial proximity to azure pixels.

**Ruminate Phase**

Based on the two examples, the transformation rule appears to be:

1. **Identify Azure Cluster:** Locate all connected azure pixels (value 8).
2. **Add Blue Pixels:** Add blue pixels (value 1) adjacent to at least one azure pixel from the cluster. The placement appears to loosely follow a pattern around the perimeter of the azure cluster.

The number of blue pixels added seems to correlate with the number of outer azure pixels.  The examples don't provide enough information to understand how many blue pixels are added for a given number of outer azure pixels.  A single isolated blue pixel might not fit the pattern, and more complex clusters with branches would need to be explored in additional examples to fully define the transformation.

To refine the transformation rule, additional test cases with diverse azure clusters (different sizes, shapes, and connectivities) are required.  The test cases should explore different ways to extend the cluster's outer boundary to assess whether this extension impacts the addition of blue pixels.

**Test Considerations:**

The lack of clear rules about which adjacent white pixels to change to blue requires careful consideration.  We need to test different scenarios involving the distribution and connections of the azure pixels.  The current hypothesis suggests that blue pixels would extend the azure cluster around its perimeter.  We need further examples to verify this and to confirm what constitutes a consistent placement.

To handle uncertainty in the transformation, I propose an approach using a probabilistic method.  Instead of strictly adding blue pixels based on rigid rules, I suggest a score system that estimates the probability of each white pixel becoming blue based on its adjacency to azure pixels.  The higher the adjacency score, the higher the probability.  This will help in cases where the transformation lacks strict rules.

Is there a specific test input for this puzzle you would like me to evaluate?  Before proceeding, I want to be sure I understand what is expected of me in the next phase.
