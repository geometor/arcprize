The working output grid is initialized correctly from the input grid.  The next step is to apply the transformation, adding blue (1) pixels adjacent to the azure (8) pixels.

The heuristic implemented in the previous `code_execution` block is a reasonable starting point, but it can be improved. Currently, it simply changes any white pixel adjacent to an azure pixel to blue. This doesn't fully capture the nuanced pattern observed in the examples.

The examples suggest that the blue pixels are added to expand the azure cluster, generally around its perimeter, while not adding a new layer around every azure pixel.  The examples suggest a priority, filling gaps first.  Therefore, a refined heuristic will be used.


**Refined Heuristic**

1. **Identify Border Pixels:** First, identify all the azure pixels (8's) that are on the border (adjacent to at least one white pixel).
2. **Prioritize Border Expansion:** For each border azure pixel, find adjacent white pixels (0's).  Change these adjacent white pixels to blue pixels(1's).
3. **Fill Gaps (Optional):**  Once the border expansion is done, optionally proceed to fill gaps in the resulting blue region which are adjacent to more than one blue pixel to improve the aesthetics and consistency of the solution. This isn't as crucial based on the examples.

Here's updated Python code incorporating this improved heuristic.  The optional gap-filling step is commented out, since its importance is less clear based on the provided examples.

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    
    def generate_output(input_grid):
        grid = np.array(input_grid)
        rows, cols = grid.shape
        output_grid = np.copy(grid)
    
        # Identify border azure pixels
        border_pixels = []
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r, c] == 8:
                    is_border = False
                    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:
                        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:
                            if (dr != 0 or dc != 0) and 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols and grid[r + dr, c + dc] == 0:
                                is_border = True
                                break
                        if is_border:
                            break
                    if is_border:
                        border_pixels.append((r, c))
    
        # Expand border with blue pixels
        for r, c in border_pixels:
            for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:
                for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:
                    if (dr != 0 or dc != 0) and 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols and output_grid[r + dr, c + dc] == 0:
                        output_grid[r + dr, c + dc] = 1
    
    
        #Optional: Fill gaps (not crucial based on examples)
        # for r in range(rows):
        #     for c in range(cols):
        #         if output_grid[r,c] == 0:
        #             adjacent_blues = 0
        #             for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:
        #                 for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:
        #                     if (dr != 0 or dc != 0) and 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols and output_grid[r + dr, c + dc] == 1:
        #                         adjacent_blues += 1
        #             if adjacent_blues > 1:
        #                 output_grid[r,c] = 1
    
        return output_grid.tolist()
    
    
    test_input = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                  [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                  [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    
    output_grid = generate_output(test_input)
    print(output_grid)

code_execution_result: 1

```
[[1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 8, 8], [8, 8, 1, 0, 1, 1, 8], [8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 1, 0], [1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], [8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

```

The refined heuristic produces the following output:

```
[[1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 8, 8],
 [8, 8, 1, 0, 1, 1, 8],
 [8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 0],
 [1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 1, 0],
 [1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
 [8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

This output seems consistent with the pattern observed in the examples. The blue pixels expand around the azure cluster, filling the adjacent white spaces in a manner that is consistent with the previous examples.  The optional gap-filling step wasn't necessary to produce a plausible result.

I am ready to submit this solution.
