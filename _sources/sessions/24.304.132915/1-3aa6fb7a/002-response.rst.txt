**example_2**

**input:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 8
objects:
  - a cluster of 8s at (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)

```

**output:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 40
  - 8: 8
  - 1: 3
objects:
  - a cluster of 8s at (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)
  - three blue pixels at (1,4), (2,3), (5,3)
```

**differences:**
```
cells_changed: 3
colors_changed: three 0s changed to 1s (blue)
```

**transformation:**
The transformation remains consistent.  It appears to be changing the adjacent 0s to 1s(blue) and leaving the rest unchanged. Specifically, 0s that share a side with an 8 are changed to 1s.

**Ruminate Phase:**

Based on the two examples, the transformation rule appears to be:

* **Identify all pixels with value 8.**
* **For each pixel with value 8, check its four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).**
* **If a neighbor has value 0, change its value to 1.**

This rule seems to accurately describe the changes observed in both examples.  There's no evidence suggesting diagonal adjacency influences the transformation.
