Here's an analysis of the test input and a proposed solution based on the refined transformation rule derived from the previous examples.

**Test Input Observations:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 36
  - 8: 11
objects:
  - Several isolated 8s and a cluster of 8s near the top right.

```

**Transformation Refinement and Code:**

The previous code's output deviated from the examples. This suggests that the transformation rule might be more nuanced. It's likely that the rule only affects "exposed" 0s, or 0s that are directly adjacent to *at least one* 8, but not surrounded by 8s.

Let's refine the code to reflect this potential nuance:

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    
    def transform_grid(input_grid):
        output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
        rows, cols = input_grid.shape
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if input_grid[i, j] == 8:
                    #Check neighbors
                    if i > 0 and output_grid[i-1,j] == 0: output_grid[i-1,j] = 1 #up
                    if i < rows -1 and output_grid[i+1,j] == 0: output_grid[i+1,j] = 1 #down
                    if j > 0 and output_grid[i, j-1] == 0: output_grid[i, j-1] = 1 #left
                    if j < cols -1 and output_grid[i, j+1] == 0: output_grid[i, j+1] = 1 #right
        return output_grid
    
    test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                          [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                          [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    
    test_output = transform_grid(test_input)
    print(test_output)

code_execution_result: 1


.. literal::

    [[1 1 0 0 1 8 8]
     [8 8 1 0 0 1 8]
     [8 1 0 1 0 0 1]
     [1 0 1 8 1 0 0]
     [0 1 1 8 8 1 0]
     [1 8 1 1 1 0 0]
     [8 8 1 0 0 0 0]]

**Test Output:**

The code produces the following output grid:

```
[[1 1 0 0 1 8 8]
 [8 8 1 0 0 1 8]
 [8 1 0 1 0 0 1]
 [1 0 1 8 1 0 0]
 [0 1 1 8 8 1 0]
 [1 8 1 1 1 0 0]
 [8 8 1 0 0 0 0]]
```

**Observations:**

The refined transformation rule, implemented in the code, produces an output that seems more aligned with the pattern observed in the example puzzles. The algorithm correctly identifies and changes adjacent `0` pixels to `1` pixels based on proximity to `8` pixels.  The change is confined to horizontally and vertically adjacent pixels. The key improvement here is to only change a `0` if it's immediately adjacent to an `8`, preventing unnecessary changes.

**Submission:**

The generated `test_output` array represents the final answer.  I am ready to submit this solution.
