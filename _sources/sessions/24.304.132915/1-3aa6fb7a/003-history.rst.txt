**observations**

**example_1**

**input:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 5
objects:
  - a cluster of 8s, starting at (1,1) and extending to (3,3)
  - a cluster of 8s, starting at (3,4) and extending to (4,5)
```

**output:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 42
  - 8: 5
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - a cluster of 8s, starting at (1,1) and extending to (3,3)
  - a cluster of 8s, starting at (3,4) and extending to (4,5)
  - a blue pixel at (1,2)
  - a blue pixel at (4,4)

```

**differences:**
```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed: two 0s changed to 1s (blue)
```

**transformation:**
```
-The transformation appears to involve changing some of the 0s (white) to 1s (blue).  Specifically, it looks like the 0s that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to an 8 are changed to 1s. The 0s that are diagonally adjacent to an 8 seem to remain unchanged.
```

To verify this hypothesis, let's examine additional examples.

**observations**

**example_2**

**input:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 8
objects:
  - a cluster of 8s at (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)

```

**output:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 40
  - 8: 8
  - 1: 3
objects:
  - a cluster of 8s at (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)
  - three blue pixels at (1,4), (2,3), (5,3)
```

**differences:**
```
cells_changed: 3
colors_changed: three 0s changed to 1s (blue)
```

**transformation:**
The transformation remains consistent.  It appears to be changing the adjacent 0s to 1s(blue) and leaving the rest unchanged. Specifically, 0s that share a side with an 8 are changed to 1s.

**Ruminate Phase:**

Based on the two examples, the transformation rule appears to be:

* **Identify all pixels with value 8.**
* **For each pixel with value 8, check its four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).**
* **If a neighbor has value 0, change its value to 1.**

This rule seems to accurately describe the changes observed in both examples.  There's no evidence suggesting diagonal adjacency influences the transformation.

**examples summary**


- summarize your observations to explain the transformation of the input to output


- use code_execution to investigate properties, patterns and differences in the grids
