**observations**



The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels forming a loose, irregular shape. The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the azure pixels have been replaced by blue (1) pixels.  Specifically, the azure pixels that are adjacent to the edge of the cluster seem to have been changed to blue.



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   difference_grid = output_grid - input_grid
   print(f"Difference Grid:\n{difference_grid}")
   print(f"Number of cells changed: {np.sum(np.abs(difference_grid))}")

   azure_indices = np.where(input_grid == 8)
   print(f"Indices of Azure pixels: {list(zip(azure_indices[0], azure_indices[1]))}")

   changed_indices = np.where(difference_grid != 0)
   print(f"Indices of changed pixels: {list(zip(changed_indices[0], changed_indices[1]))}")

   Number of cells changed: 2
   Indices of Azure pixels: [(np.int64(1), np.int64(1)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(1)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(2)), (np.int64(3), np.int64(4)), (np.int64(3), np.int64(5)), (np.int64(4), np.int64(5))]

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 6
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: (1,1), color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 4
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 4, position: (1,1), color: azure
       - size: 2, position: (1,2), (4,4) color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue.
   transformation:
     - Some azure pixels bordering the outside of the azure cluster become blue.

Based on the analysis, the transformation rule seems to be that some (not all) azure pixels located at the edge of the cluster of azure pixels change to blue.  Further examples are needed to refine this rule and determine the exact selection criteria for which azure pixels are changed.

INSTRUCTIONS:




* 
  Review Examples Phase

  pairs of input and output grids will be shown to you one at a time

  you will examine and analyze the text and image for each example

  you may use code execution with tools like numpy to examine patterns
  after examining the grids, document the attributes of each as such

  use a yaml block for the details

  .. code-block:: yaml

     input:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     output:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     differences:
       cells_changed: N
       colors_changed: desc
     transformation:
       - speculate on transformation rules

  your response for this phase should contain the following content parts


  * begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
    grid
  * run a ``code_execution`` part to test your perceptions - since the code you
    use may not be carried forward on following prompts, be sure to have the code print
    you findings in the output
    remember that you have access to many python libraries for analyzing the grids and validating patterns
  * review your findings and try to determine what the natural language program is for the transformation
