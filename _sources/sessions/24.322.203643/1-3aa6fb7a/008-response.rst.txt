008 â€¢ Response
==============


The changes made to the working output grid (changing pixel (1,5) to blue) align with the observed pattern from previous examples.  The pixel (1,5) is located at the outer edge of a cluster of azure pixels.

However, the rule remains imprecise.  It's still not entirely clear which edge pixels are chosen for transformation. The selection seems somewhat arbitrary, and a more precise definition of the rule is needed for consistent prediction.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   working_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                             [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8],
                             [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                             [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])


   def find_edges(grid):
       rows, cols = grid.shape
       edges = []
       for r in range(rows):
           for c in range(cols):
               if grid[r, c] == 8:
                   if r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 or \
                      grid[r - 1, c] == 0 or grid[r + 1, c] == 0 or \
                      grid[r, c - 1] == 0 or grid[r, c + 1] == 0:
                       edges.append((r, c))
       return edges

   edges = find_edges(working_output)
   print(f"Edges of Azure Clusters in Working Output: {edges}")

code_execution_result: 1

.. code-block::

   Edges of Azure Clusters in Working Output: [(0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 0), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1)]

The code shows all the edges after the change.  The lack of a clearly defined rule makes it impossible to guarantee the correctness of the solution.  More examples are needed.
