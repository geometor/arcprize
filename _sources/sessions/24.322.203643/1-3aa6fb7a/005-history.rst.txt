**observations**



The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels forming a loose, irregular shape. The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the azure pixels have been replaced by blue (1) pixels.  Specifically, the azure pixels that are adjacent to the edge of the cluster seem to have been changed to blue.

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

Based on the analysis, the transformation rule seems to be that some (not all) azure pixels located at the edge of the cluster of azure pixels change to blue.  Further examples are needed to refine this rule and determine the exact selection criteria for which azure pixels are changed.

**observations**



The input grid in example 2 shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels arranged in an irregular, somewhat L-shaped pattern. The output grid is very similar, but several azure pixels on the outer edge of the cluster have been changed to blue (1) pixels.

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue.
   transformation:
     - Some azure pixels bordering the outside of the azure cluster become blue.

The transformation in example 2 further supports the hypothesis that some azure pixels on the outer edge of the cluster are changed to blue.  The selection of which pixels change remains unclear, requiring more examples.  The number of pixels changed seems to vary depending on the shape of the cluster.



**examples summary**



The transformation converts some azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels. Specifically, it appears that azure pixels located at the outer edge of a connected cluster of azure pixels are changed to blue. The number of pixels that change varies depending on the shape and size of the azure cluster.  The selection of which edge pixels are changed isn't entirely clear from these two examples;  more examples are needed to determine the precise rule for selecting which azure pixels to change.

The code identifies the edges of the azure clusters.  Comparing the changed pixels to the edges shows that some (but not all) edge pixels are changed. A more sophisticated algorithm is needed to precisely predict which edge pixels change to blue. The current evidence suggests that the algorithm may prioritize changing pixels at the corners or certain types of edge locations. More examples are crucial for a definitive rule.

**observations**



Here's an analysis of the test input grid, followed by a prediction for the output grid.

**Test Input Analysis**

The test input grid presents a more complex arrangement of azure (8) pixels than the previous examples.  The azure pixels are not clustered in a single connected component; instead, they form several smaller, disconnected clusters and individual pixels. This suggests that the transformation will be applied independently to each cluster.

   All edges: [(0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 0), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1)]

The code correctly identifies the clusters and then identifies the edges of each cluster.

**Prediction**

Based on the previous examples,  I predict that the transformation will change some of the azure pixels on the outer edges of each cluster to blue (1).  Because the clusters are separate and not connected, the transformation is applied to each cluster independently.  Without a precise rule for selection, it's difficult to predict exactly which pixels will be changed but the code has identified possible candidates

**Predicted Output**

To generate a precise prediction, a more refined rule for pixel selection is needed. However, a possible output based on the observation that corner and edge pixels are frequently selected could be:

.. code-block::

   [[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]
    [8 8 0 0 0 1 8]
    [8 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
    [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

This output reflects a possible transformation. The exact output would depend on the detailed selection rule, which remains unclear from the provided examples.  More data is needed to determine a more reliable prediction.



**initialize the working output grid:**



====



INSTRUCTIONS:



use function_call to initialize the working output grid:


* initialize_output_from_input: good when examples show few differences between
  input and output
* initialize_output_by_size: create a fresh grid from size and color
