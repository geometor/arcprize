.. code-block::

   Difference Grid:
   [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 1 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
   Number of cells changed: 2
   Edges: [(0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 0), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1)]
   Changed Pixels: [(np.int64(1), np.int64(5)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(1))]



The code execution shows that only two cells were changed in my prediction.  The changed pixels (1,5) and (2,1) are both on the edge of their respective clusters. This aligns with the observed pattern, however, it is important to note that not all edge pixels are changed.  The selection criteria for which edge pixels are modified remains elusive.  More examples would be needed to refine the rule and achieve a higher degree of accuracy.  The current rule is too vague and only works sometimes.  Therefore more examples would improve the accuracy of the rule significantly.
