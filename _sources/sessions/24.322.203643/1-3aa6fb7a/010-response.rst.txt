010 â€¢ Response
==============


The changes made to the working output grid are consistent with the observed pattern: transforming some azure (8) pixels at the edges of clusters to blue (1). However, the selection of which specific edge pixels are altered remains unclear. A definitive rule cannot be established based on the limited examples.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   working_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                             [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8],
                             [8, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                             [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   def find_edges(grid):
       rows, cols = grid.shape
       edges = []
       for r in range(rows):
           for c in range(cols):
               if grid[r, c] == 8:
                   if r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 or \
                      grid[r - 1, c] == 0 or grid[r + 1, c] == 0 or \
                      grid[r, c - 1] == 0 or grid[r, c + 1] == 0:
                       edges.append((r, c))
       return edges

   edges = find_edges(working_output)
   print(f"Edges of Azure Clusters in Working Output: {edges}")

code_execution_result: 1

.. code-block::

   Edges of Azure Clusters in Working Output: [(0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 0), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1)]

The code shows that the edge detection function correctly identifies the edges of the azure clusters even after some pixels have been changed to blue.  The lack of a clear selection rule for which edge pixels to modify persists.  More examples are needed.  The algorithm should be able to take the cluster as input and determine which edge pixels should be changed.  The algorithm's current state is too simplistic to handle this task reliably.
