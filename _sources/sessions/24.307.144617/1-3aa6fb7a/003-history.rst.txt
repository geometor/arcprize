**input:**
  width: 7
  height: 7

    - 0: 43
    - 8: 6
  objects:
    - size: 3x2, position: (1,1), color: azure(8)
**output:**

  colors:

    - 1: 2
  objects:
    - size: 3x2, position: (1,1), color: azure(8)
    - size: 1x1, position: (1,2), color: blue(1)
    - size: 1x1, position: (4,4), color: blue(1)
**differences:**
  cells_changed: 2
  colors_changed: Added blue(1)
**transformation:**
- The transformation adds two blue pixels. One to the right of the top-most azure pixel, and one to the bottom right of the bottom-most azure pixel.  There's a pattern of adding blue pixels to the "corners" of the azure block, but more information is needed to determine the general rule.

**observations**

Based on the two examples provided, the transformation appears to involve adding blue (1) pixels to the input grid.  The placement of the new blue pixels seems to be related to the existing azure (8) pixels.
Specifically:
* **Example 1:** A single blue pixel is added to the right of the topmost azure pixel and another below the bottom-most azure pixel.  These added blue pixels are adjacent to, but not directly overlapping, existing azure pixels and are on the "outer edges" of the cluster of azure pixels.
* **Example 2:**  Again, blue pixels are added.  One is added to the right of the topmost azure pixel in the cluster, another to the bottom-right of the bottom-most azure, and a third is added to the right of a lone azure pixel, following a similar adjacency pattern.
**Hypothesis:**
The transformation rule adds a blue pixel adjacent to each "exposed" edge of the cluster of azure pixels. An "exposed" edge is defined as an edge not touching another azure pixel.
To verify this hypothesis and to handle more complex scenarios, a more robust algorithm would be needed.  This algorithm should:
1. **Identify Azure Clusters:**  Identify connected groups of azure (8) pixels.
2. **Find Exposed Edges:** For each azure cluster, determine which azure pixels have at least one adjacent pixel that isn't azure (8).
3. **Add Blue Pixels:**  For each exposed azure pixel, add a blue (1) pixel adjacent to it, based on a defined adjacency rule (e.g., adding to the right if the exposed edge is on the left).
Further examples are needed to determine the exact method of adjacency and to determine how the algorithm would behave when an exposed edge is located near the edge of the grid, which is unclear from these two examples.
