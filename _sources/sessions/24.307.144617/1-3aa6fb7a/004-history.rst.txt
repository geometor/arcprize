**differences:**

**transformation:**
- The transformation adds two blue pixels. One to the right of the top-most azure pixel, and one to the bottom right of the bottom-most azure pixel.  There's a pattern of adding blue pixels to the "corners" of the azure block, but more information is needed to determine the general rule.

**observations**

Based on the two examples provided, the transformation appears to involve adding blue (1) pixels to the input grid.  The placement of the new blue pixels seems to be related to the existing azure (8) pixels.
Specifically:
* **Example 1:** A single blue pixel is added to the right of the topmost azure pixel and another below the bottom-most azure pixel.  These added blue pixels are adjacent to, but not directly overlapping, existing azure pixels and are on the "outer edges" of the cluster of azure pixels.
* **Example 2:**  Again, blue pixels are added.  One is added to the right of the topmost azure pixel in the cluster, another to the bottom-right of the bottom-most azure, and a third is added to the right of a lone azure pixel, following a similar adjacency pattern.
**Hypothesis:**
The transformation rule adds a blue pixel adjacent to each "exposed" edge of the cluster of azure pixels. An "exposed" edge is defined as an edge not touching another azure pixel.
To verify this hypothesis and to handle more complex scenarios, a more robust algorithm would be needed.  This algorithm should:
1. **Identify Azure Clusters:**  Identify connected groups of azure (8) pixels.
2. **Find Exposed Edges:** For each azure cluster, determine which azure pixels have at least one adjacent pixel that isn't azure (8).
3. **Add Blue Pixels:**  For each exposed azure pixel, add a blue (1) pixel adjacent to it, based on a defined adjacency rule (e.g., adding to the right if the exposed edge is on the left).
Further examples are needed to determine the exact method of adjacency and to determine how the algorithm would behave when an exposed edge is located near the edge of the grid, which is unclear from these two examples.

**examples summary**

The transformation consistently adds blue (1) pixels to the input grid.  These additions are spatially related to the existing azure (8) pixels.  The blue pixels are added to locations adjacent to, but not overlapping, the azure pixels, specifically at exposed edges of clusters of azure pixels (an exposed edge being defined as a side of an azure pixel not touching another azure pixel).
More precisely, it appears that a blue pixel is added to the right of any azure pixel with an open space to its right, and below any azure pixel with an open space below it. The specific adjacency rule might be more complex and needs further verification with additional examples. The current hypothesis is that the rule adds a blue pixel adjacent to each exposed edge where space permits, possibly prioritizing right and then down.
To further investigate and solidify this hypothesis,  a more formalized algorithm is needed to handle complex shapes and edge cases:
1. **Identify Connected Components (Azure Clusters):** Use a graph-based approach or connected component labeling to find groups of connected azure pixels.
2. **Find Exposed Edges:** Determine azure pixels bordering a non-azure pixel.
3. **Add Blue Pixels (Consistently):**  For each exposed edge, add a blue pixel to the right (if possible) or below (if possible). This prioritizes right-then-down, but this might need modification after seeing more examples.
Code to perform connected component labeling is shown below for reference.

The `find_azure_clusters` function, using SciPy's `label` function, correctly identifies connected components of azure pixels.  The output shows that the azure pixels are grouped into distinct clusters.  This is a crucial first step in implementing the proposed algorithm for the transformation.  The next step would be to identify the exposed edges of these clusters and add the blue pixels accordingly.  Further examples would help refine the precise rules for placing the new blue pixels (e.g., resolving ambiguities regarding adjacency when multiple directions are open).
