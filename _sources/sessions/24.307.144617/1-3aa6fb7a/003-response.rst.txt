The transformation consistently adds blue (1) pixels to the input grid.  These additions are spatially related to the existing azure (8) pixels.  The blue pixels are added to locations adjacent to, but not overlapping, the azure pixels, specifically at exposed edges of clusters of azure pixels (an exposed edge being defined as a side of an azure pixel not touching another azure pixel).
More precisely, it appears that a blue pixel is added to the right of any azure pixel with an open space to its right, and below any azure pixel with an open space below it. The specific adjacency rule might be more complex and needs further verification with additional examples. The current hypothesis is that the rule adds a blue pixel adjacent to each exposed edge where space permits, possibly prioritizing right and then down.
To further investigate and solidify this hypothesis,  a more formalized algorithm is needed to handle complex shapes and edge cases:
1. **Identify Connected Components (Azure Clusters):** Use a graph-based approach or connected component labeling to find groups of connected azure pixels.
2. **Find Exposed Edges:** Determine azure pixels bordering a non-azure pixel.
3. **Add Blue Pixels (Consistently):**  For each exposed edge, add a blue pixel to the right (if possible) or below (if possible). This prioritizes right-then-down, but this might need modification after seeing more examples.
Code to perform connected component labeling is shown below for reference.

The `find_azure_clusters` function, using SciPy's `label` function, correctly identifies connected components of azure pixels.  The output shows that the azure pixels are grouped into distinct clusters.  This is a crucial first step in implementing the proposed algorithm for the transformation.  The next step would be to identify the exposed edges of these clusters and add the blue pixels accordingly.  Further examples would help refine the precise rules for placing the new blue pixels (e.g., resolving ambiguities regarding adjacency when multiple directions are open).
