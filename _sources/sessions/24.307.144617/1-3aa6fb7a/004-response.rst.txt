Here's a report based on the provided examples and the test input, incorporating code execution to analyze the patterns:
**Examples Summary and Hypothesis Refinement:**
The transformation consistently adds blue (1) pixels adjacent to, but not overlapping, existing azure (8) pixels. The addition follows a specific adjacency pattern: a blue pixel is added to the right of any azure pixel with an open space to its right, and below any azure pixel with an open space below it, prioritizing right then down.
**Code for Transformation (Python):**
This code implements the refined hypothesis. It uses connected-component labeling to find clusters, then identifies exposed edges to add blue pixels:

**Test Results:**
The `transform_grid` function successfully replicates the observed transformation for both Example 1 and Example 2. The results for the test input are shown in the `tool_outputs` section above.  This is consistent with our refined hypothesis.
**Further Considerations:**
While the code correctly implements the current hypothesis, there are factors to consider:
* **Edge Cases:** The code handles some edge cases (clusters near grid boundaries), but more examples are needed to test for a variety of shapes and edge cases and to potentially adjust the rule for adding blue pixels near boundaries.  There is an implicit assumption in the algorithm that a blue pixel will only ever be added to the immediate right or below of an azure pixel.  More examples are needed to determine if this is always the case.
* **More Complex Scenarios:**  The rule might become more intricate with larger or more complex azure clusters.  More examples will help validate the current rule or reveal additional aspects of the transformation.
* **Efficiency:**  For very large grids, optimizations might be necessary to improve the algorithm's efficiency.
In summary, the current algorithm is a solid starting point, but more data is needed to solidify its robustness and handle edge cases effectively. The algorithm accurately reflects the transformation observed in the provided examples and performs as expected on the test case.
