Here's an analysis of example 2, followed by a revised hypothesis encompassing both examples:

**Example 2**

**Input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 8
objects:
  - a cluster of 8s in an irregular shape
```

**Output:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 40
  - 8: 8
  - 1: 3
objects:
  - a cluster of 8s similar to the input
  - three 1s have appeared, one at (1,5), one at (2,3), one at (5,3)
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 3
colors_changed: three 0s changed to 1s
```

**Transformation:**

Similar to example 1, `0` pixels are changed to `1` pixels. However, the placement of the `1`s in this example doesn't perfectly fit the "corner" hypothesis from example 1. It seems more like it's related to the perimeter of the cluster of 8s. More precisely, it's related to locations that are adjacent to a single 8 and not adjacent to another 0.



**Revised Hypothesis (Examples 1 & 2):**

The transformation appears to involve identifying `0` pixels that are adjacent to at least one `8` and not adjacent to another `0` (horizontally or vertically). These selected `0` pixels are then changed to `1`s.  The hypothesis about upper-right and lower-left corners may be an artifact of the simpler cluster in example 1.  The placement of the 1's is not consistently based on the corners but on the periphery of the 8-cluster.

**Further Testing:**

To validate this revised hypothesis, more examples are needed, particularly those with:

*   Different shapes and sizes of the `8` clusters.
*   `8` clusters that are not simply connected (e.g., multiple separate clusters).
*   Situations where `0` pixels are adjacent to multiple `8`s but still only one `0` is transformed.  This will help us refine the "not adjacent to another 0" rule.


This improved hypothesis offers a more robust and generalizable rule.  The next step is to rigorously test it with a wider range of input variations.
