Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 6
objects:
  - a cluster of 8s starting at (1,1) and extending to (4,6)
```

**Output:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 42
  - 8: 6
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - a cluster of 8s similar to the input
  - two 1s have appeared, one at (1,2), one at (4,5)
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed: two 0s changed to 1s
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve changing some `0` pixels to `1` pixels. The locations of these changes seem to be related to the edges or corners of the cluster of `8`s. Specifically, it seems to add `1`s to the upper right and lower left corners (relative to the main cluster).  It's not clear what determines the exact placement or whether all potential corners would be changed.  Further examples are needed to confirm the pattern and to evaluate exceptions.

To test this hypothesis, more examples are needed.  The current example is insufficient to definitively determine the rules governing the transformation.  The placement of the `1`s is not fully clear based on this single example.
