**observations**

Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**example_1**

**input:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 6
objects:
  - A cluster of 8s forms a roughly L shape.
```

**output:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 42
  - 8: 6
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - The L shape of 8s remains. Two 1s (blue) appear where white (0) was in the input.  Specifically, the 1s appear to the upper right of an existing 8 in the input.
```

**differences:**
```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed: Two white (0) cells have changed to blue (1).
```

**transformation:**
```
- The transformation appears to involve adding blue (1) pixels.
- The location of these new pixels (1) are adjacent and to the upper right of some of the existing azure (8) pixels.  This suggests adjacency and potentially a directional relationship is important.
- It does not seem to involve changing the values of existing pixels or removing pixels, only adding new ones.
```

Based on this single example, a potential transformation rule is:  For each azure (8) pixel, add a blue (1) pixel to its upper-right if that location is currently white (0).  Additional examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis and to handle edge cases.  The rule needs clarification on what happens when an 8 is in a corner.

**example_2**

**input**


.. code-block::

    [[0 0 0 0 8 8 0]
     [0 0 0 0 0 8 0]
     [0 0 8 0 0 0 0]
     [0 0 8 8 0 0 0]
     [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
     [0 0 0 0 8 0 0]
     [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]]

**observations**

**example_2**

**input:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 9
objects:
  - Multiple clusters of 8s, some forming vertical and horizontal lines.
```

**output:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 40
  - 8: 9
  - 1: 3
objects:
  - The clusters of 8s remain. Three 1s (blue) appear where white (0) was in the input. They appear adjacent and to the upper-right of some existing 8s, similar to Example 1.
```

**differences:**
```
cells_changed: 3
colors_changed: Three white (0) cells have changed to blue (1).
```

**transformation:**
```
- Consistent with Example 1, the transformation adds blue (1) pixels to the upper-right of azure (8) pixels, where the upper-right cell is white (0).
- The rule seems to apply independently to each azure (8) pixel.
```

**Ruminate Phase:**

The transformation rule appears to be:  For each azure (8) pixel, add a blue (1) pixel to its upper-right, *only if* the upper-right location is currently white (0).  Let's test this hypothesis.

**Considerations:**

- **Edge Cases:**  What happens when an azure (8) pixel is at the right or top edge?  It seems that no blue (1) pixel is added to the upper-right.

**examples summary**

- summarize your observations to explain the transformation of the input to output

- use code_execution to investigate properties, patterns and differences in the grids
