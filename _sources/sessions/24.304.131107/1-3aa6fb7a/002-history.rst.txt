**observations**

Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**example_1**

**input:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 43
    - 8: 6
  objects:
    - A single cluster of 8's with a roughly rectangular shape.

**output:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 42
    - 8: 6
    - 1: 2
  objects:
    - Same cluster of 8's as input.
    - Two single 1's in the top right corner of two 8's.

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 2
  colors_changed: Two '8' cells changed to '1'.  These changes appear in the top-right corner of the cluster of 8's.

**transformation:**
  - It appears that the transformation involves changing certain '8' cells to '1' cells based on their position within the larger cluster of '8's. The change only affects cells which are adjacent to at least one other '8', diagonally or orthogonally, that is,  they must be located at the upper right boundary.

Let me know if you would like me to analyze additional examples.  I'm ready for the next step.
