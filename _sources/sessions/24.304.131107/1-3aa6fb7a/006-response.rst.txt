The working output grid is initialized correctly as a copy of the input grid.  Before proceeding with the transformation, let's verify that the `transform_grid` function, as refined in the previous step, will produce the expected output for this test case.  This will confirm that our transformation rule and its implementation are accurate.



code_execution:
```python
import numpy as np

def find_clusters(grid):
    grid_copy = np.copy(grid)
    clusters = []
    for i in range(grid_copy.shape[0]):
        for j in range(grid_copy.shape[1]):
            if grid_copy[i, j] == 8:
                cluster = []
                queue = [(i, j)]
                while queue:
                    curr_i, curr_j = queue.pop(0)
                    if grid_copy[curr_i, curr_j] == 8:
                        grid_copy[curr_i, curr_j] = -1 #Mark visited
                        cluster.append((curr_i, curr_j))
                        for x in range(max(0, curr_i - 1), min(grid_copy.shape[0], curr_i + 2)):
                            for y in range(max(0, curr_j - 1), min(grid_copy.shape[1], curr_j + 2)):
                                if (x,y) != (curr_i, curr_j) and grid_copy[x, y] == 8:
                                    queue.append((x, y))
                clusters.append(cluster)

    return clusters

def is_top_right_boundary(cluster, cell, grid):
    row, col = cell
    has_neighbor = False
    for x in range(max(0, row - 1), min(grid.shape[0], row + 2)):
        for y in range(max(0, col - 1), min(grid.shape[1], col + 2)):
            if (x,y) != (row,col) and grid[x,y] == 8:
                has_neighbor = True
    if not has_neighbor:
        return False

    for r,c in cluster:
        if r > row or c > col:
            return False
    return True


def transform_grid(grid):
  clusters = find_clusters(grid)
  output_grid = np.copy(grid)
  for cluster in clusters:
    for cell in cluster:
        if is_top_right_boundary(cluster, cell, grid):
          output_grid[cell] = 1
  return output_grid


test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                      [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

transformed_grid = transform_grid(test_input)
print(transformed_grid)
```
code_execution_result: 1
```
[[0 0 0 0 0 8 1]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 1]
 [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 1 0 0]
 [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [8 1 0 0 0 0 0]]
```

The code confirms the predicted output.  The `transform_grid` function accurately applies the transformation rule to the test input.  Therefore, we can proceed to submit this as the final output.
