**observations**

Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**example_1**

**input:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 43
    - 8: 6
  objects:
    - A single cluster of 8's with a roughly rectangular shape.

**output:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 42
    - 8: 6
    - 1: 2
  objects:
    - Same cluster of 8's as input.
    - Two single 1's in the top right corner of two 8's.

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 2
  colors_changed: Two '8' cells changed to '1'.  These changes appear in the top-right corner of the cluster of 8's.

**transformation:**
  - It appears that the transformation involves changing certain '8' cells to '1' cells based on their position within the larger cluster of '8's. The change only affects cells which are adjacent to at least one other '8', diagonally or orthogonally, that is,  they must be located at the upper right boundary.

Let me know if you would like me to analyze additional examples.  I'm ready for the next step.

**observations**


**example_2**

**input:

**

  width: 7

  height: 7

  colors:

    - 0: 43

    - 8: 9

  objects:

    - Multiple clusters of 8's.  No single large cluster.

**output:**

  width: 7

  height: 7

  colors:

    - 0: 40

    - 8: 9

    - 1: 3

  objects:

    - Same clusters of 8's as input,  with three '1's added.

**differences:**

  cells_changed: 3

  colors_changed: Three '8' cells changed to '1'.  These changes are also located on the boundary of a cluster, where a cell of 8 is in a location where it is orthogonally or diagonally next to at least one other 8.  The change is to the top right of a cell with value 8 that is next to another 8.

**transformation:**

  - Consistent with example 1, the transformation appears to involve changing some '8' cells to '1' cells.  These changes again seem to occur on the upper-right boundary of clusters of 8's. The pattern appears to be to change cells with value 8 to cells with value 1 when that cell is in a position where its position relative to other cells with value 8 is in the top right position of an 8 cluster.

**Summary of Transformations:**

Based on the two examples, the transformation rule seems to be:

Identify clusters of '8's. For each '8' cell that is located at a top-right boundary of a cluster (meaning it's adjacent to at least one other '8' cell but is not on a horizontal boundary or diagonal boundary with any other cell of value 8) change the color from 8 to 1.  A "top-right boundary" means it's not at the bottom or left of another '8'.

I'm ready for the next step.

**examples summary**


- summarize your observations to explain the transformation of the input to output


- use code_execution to investigate properties, patterns and differences in the grids
