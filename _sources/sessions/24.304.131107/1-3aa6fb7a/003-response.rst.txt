The transformation rule appears to be a localized change affecting only cells with the value '8'.  Specifically, '8' cells are changed to '1's based on their position relative to other '8' cells within clusters.

The rule seems to be:  For every 8, check its neighbors (orthogonally and diagonally). If the 8 is at the top-right boundary of a cluster (meaning it has at least one '8' neighbor but is not at the bottom or left edge of the cluster), change it to a '1'.


Let's use code to test this hypothesis.  We'll need to define a function to identify clusters and boundary cells.

                    cluster = []
                    queue = [(i, j)]
                    while queue:
                        curr_i, curr_j = queue.pop(0)
                        if grid_copy[curr_i, curr_j] == 8:

The code correctly reproduces the outputs for Example 1 but not for Example 2.  The `is_top_right_boundary` function needs refinement.  It currently only checks if a cell is not below or to the left of any other 8 in the cluster.  It needs to verify that it's actually at a top-right boundary, meaning it has at least one neighbor.

Let's revise the `is_top_right_boundary` function:

The revised code now produces the correct output for both examples.  The key change was adding the `has_neighbor` check to ensure a cell is part of a cluster before considering it a boundary cell.  This addresses the issue encountered previously.  The algorithm accurately identifies clusters of 8's and correctly transforms the top-right boundary cells within those clusters.
