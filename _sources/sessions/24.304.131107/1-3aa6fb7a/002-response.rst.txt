**example_2**

**input:

**

  width: 7

  height: 7

  colors:

    - 0: 43

    - 8: 9

  objects:

    - Multiple clusters of 8's.  No single large cluster.

**output:**

  width: 7

  height: 7

  colors:

    - 0: 40

    - 8: 9

    - 1: 3

  objects:

    - Same clusters of 8's as input,  with three '1's added.

**differences:**

  cells_changed: 3

  colors_changed: Three '8' cells changed to '1'.  These changes are also located on the boundary of a cluster, where a cell of 8 is in a location where it is orthogonally or diagonally next to at least one other 8.  The change is to the top right of a cell with value 8 that is next to another 8.

**transformation:**

  - Consistent with example 1, the transformation appears to involve changing some '8' cells to '1' cells.  These changes again seem to occur on the upper-right boundary of clusters of 8's. The pattern appears to be to change cells with value 8 to cells with value 1 when that cell is in a position where its position relative to other cells with value 8 is in the top right position of an 8 cluster.

**Summary of Transformations:**

Based on the two examples, the transformation rule seems to be:

Identify clusters of '8's. For each '8' cell that is located at a top-right boundary of a cluster (meaning it's adjacent to at least one other '8' cell but is not on a horizontal boundary or diagonal boundary with any other cell of value 8) change the color from 8 to 1.  A "top-right boundary" means it's not at the bottom or left of another '8'.

I'm ready for the next step.
