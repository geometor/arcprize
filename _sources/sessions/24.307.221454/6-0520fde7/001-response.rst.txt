001 â€¢ Response
==============


Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 0: 11
       - 1: 5
       - 5: 1
     objects:
       - size: 3x7, position: 0,0, color: blue and white
       - size: 1x1, position: 3,1, color: gray

   output:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 0: 8
       - 2: 1
     objects:
       - size: 1x1, position: 1,1, color: red

   differences:
     cells_changed: 21
     colors_changed: Input colors are reduced to only red and white in the output.  The structure/shape is vastly different.
   transformation:
     - The output is a smaller grid.
     - The output seems to focus on a single element from the input (the gray square).  The location of the gray square doesn't directly correlate to the location of the red square in the output.
     - The number of blue squares may be relevant to the size change (reduction).

**Initial Thoughts and Questions:**

The transformation is not immediately obvious.  The size of the output grid is significantly smaller than the input. The relationship between the color values in the input and output is unclear, although the gray block in the input seems to relate to the red block in the output.  The number of blue squares in the input might be important in determining the output size reduction, but more examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis.  The absolute position of objects in the input grid does not map directly to the position of objects in the output grid.  The challenge appears to involve some form of abstraction.  More examples are crucial to understanding the transformation rules.
