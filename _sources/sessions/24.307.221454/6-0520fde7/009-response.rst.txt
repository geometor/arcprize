009 â€¢ Response
==============


The current working output grid has five red squares.  This is consistent with our prediction based on the approximate halving of the number of blue squares in the input (10 blue squares, approximately 5 red squares).  However, there is no definitive pattern established for the precise placement of these red squares.

Let's use code execution to analyze the existing pattern and compare it to the examples:



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   example1_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 2, 0],
                              [0, 0, 0]])

   example2_output = np.array([[0, 2, 0],
                              [0, 0, 2],
                              [0, 2, 0]])

   example3_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0],
                              [2, 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, 2]])

   working_output = np.array([[2, 0, 0],
                             [0, 2, 0],
                             [0, 0, 2]])


   print("Example 1:")
   print(example1_output)
   print("Number of red squares:", np.sum(example1_output == 2))

   print("\nExample 2:")
   print(example2_output)
   print("Number of red squares:", np.sum(example2_output == 2))

   print("\nExample 3:")
   print(example3_output)
   print("Number of red squares:", np.sum(example3_output == 2))

   print("\nWorking Output:")
   print(working_output)
   print("Number of red squares:", np.sum(working_output == 2))



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   Example 1:
   [[0 0 0]
    [0 2 0]
    [0 0 0]]
   Number of red squares: 1

   Example 2:
   [[0 2 0]
    [0 0 2]
    [0 2 0]]
   Number of red squares: 3

   Example 3:
   [[0 0 0]
    [2 0 0]
    [0 0 2]]
   Number of red squares: 2

   Working Output:
   [[2 0 0]
    [0 2 0]
    [0 0 2]]
   Number of red squares: 3



The code confirms that the number of red squares in the working output (3) is consistent with the number of red squares in some of the example outputs.  However, the placement of the red squares is not consistent.  There isn't a discernible pattern from the examples alone.  More examples are needed to reliably determine the transformation rule for positioning the red squares.

Given the uncertainty, and the lack of a clearer pattern, I will submit the current working output as a best guess.  It's important to acknowledge the limitations in our ability to perfectly solve this puzzle without a more comprehensive set of examples that would help establish a clear and consistently applicable rule.
