Based on the three examples, the transformation from input to output involves several steps:


#. **Input Grid Analysis:** The input grid is a 3x7 matrix.  The key features are:

   * A single gray (5) square.
   * Multiple blue (1) squares.


#. 
   **Output Grid Initialization:** The output grid is always a 3x3 matrix, filled initially with white (0) squares.

#. 
   **Red Square Placement:** The number of red (2) squares in the output is directly related to the number of blue (1) squares in the input grid.  The exact relationship needs further investigation but a reasonable guess is that the number of red squares is roughly half the number of blue squares.

#. 
   **Red Square Positioning:** The positioning of the red squares in the 3x3 output seems to follow a pattern related to the corners, but  a precise rule cannot be established with only three examples.  More examples with varying numbers of blue squares are needed to confirm this hypothesis and define the pattern precisely.

**Code Execution for Pattern Investigation:**

To further investigate the pattern, we'll analyze the examples using Python:

.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   example1_input = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0],
                            [0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1],
                            [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]])

   example1_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 2, 0],
                              [0, 0, 0]])

   example2_input = np.array([[1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0],
                            [0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1],
                            [1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]])

   example2_output = np.array([[0, 2, 0],
                              [0, 0, 2],
                              [0, 2, 0]])

   example3_input = np.array([[0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0],
                            [1, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 1],
                            [0, 1, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1]])

   example3_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0],
                              [2, 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, 2]])

   # Count blue squares in each input
   blue_count1 = np.count_nonzero(example1_input == 1)
   blue_count2 = np.count_nonzero(example2_input == 1)
   blue_count3 = np.count_nonzero(example3_input == 1)

   # Count red squares in each output
   red_count1 = np.count_nonzero(example1_output == 2)
   red_count2 = np.count_nonzero(example2_output == 2)
   red_count3 = np.count_nonzero(example3_output == 2)


   print(f"Example 1: Blue squares = {blue_count1}, Red squares = {red_count1}")
   print(f"Example 2: Blue squares = {blue_count2}, Red squares = {red_count2}")
   print(f"Example 3: Blue squares = {blue_count3}, Red squares = {red_count3}")

.. code-block::

   Example 1: Blue squares = 7, Red squares = 1
   Example 2: Blue squares = 10, Red squares = 3
   Example 3: Blue squares = 9, Red squares = 2



The code confirms the number of blue squares and red squares in each example.  The relationship isn't perfectly linear (it's not exactly half the number of blue squares), but there's a clear correlation: more blue squares lead to more red squares in the output.  Further investigation is needed to determine the exact function governing this relationship.

To refine the hypothesis, more examples are crucial, particularly examples with a wider range of blue square counts.  The positioning of the red squares remains the biggest mystery—additional examples should help determine if there is a consistent, non-random pattern to this aspect of the transformation.
