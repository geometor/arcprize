.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 0: 10
       - 1: 6
       - 5: 1
     objects:
       - size: 3x7, position: 0,0, color: blue and white
       - size: 1x1, position: 3,1, color: gray

   output:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 0: 8
       - 2: 3
     objects:
       - size: 1x1, position: 1,0, color: red
       - size: 1x1, position: 2,2, color: red
       - size: 1x1, position: 0,2, color: red

   differences:
     cells_changed: 21
     colors_changed: Input colors are reduced to only red and white in the output. The structure/shape is vastly different.
   transformation:
     - The output is a smaller grid.
     - The output seems to focus on a single element from the input (the gray square). The location of the gray square doesn't directly correlate to the location of the red squares in the output.
     - The number of blue squares in the input might be relevant to the output. The more blue squares, the more red squares in the output.

**Example 2 Analysis:**

Comparing Example 1 and Example 2 reveals a potential pattern:


* 
  **Gray Square:** Both input grids contain a single gray (5) square. This square seems to be a key element.

* 
  **Output Size:** The output grids are smaller than the input grids. The number of blue squares in the input seems correlated to the number of red squares in the output (5 blue squares in example 1 results in 1 red square; 6 blue squares in example 2 results in 3 red squares).


* **Output Red Squares:** The arrangement of red squares in the output does not directly correlate to the position of the gray square in the input, it could be related to the number of blue squares.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

The transformation involves:


#. **Identifying the gray square:**  Locate the single gray (5) square in the input.
#. **Counting blue squares:** Count the number of blue (1) squares in the input.
#. **Determining output size:** The output grid will be 3x3.
#. **Placing red squares:**  The number of blue squares in the input determines the number of red (2) squares in the output.  The specific placement of red squares within the 3x3 grid might follow a consistent but currently undefined pattern.

**Next Steps:**

More examples are needed to refine the pattern for placing red squares in the output. The relationship between the number of blue squares and the arrangement of red squares is still unclear. A more robust hypothesis about the output's red square placement is needed.

To test this hypothesis, we would need additional examples with varying numbers of blue squares.
