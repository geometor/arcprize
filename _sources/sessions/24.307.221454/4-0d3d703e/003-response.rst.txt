.. code-block:: yaml

   example_3:
     input:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 5: 3
         - 8: 3
         - 6: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x1, position: 0,0, color: gray
         - size: 3x1, position: 1,0, color: azure
         - size: 3x1, position: 2,0, color: magenta
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 1: 3
         - 9: 3
         - 2: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x1, position: 0,0, color: blue
         - size: 3x1, position: 1,0, color: maroon
         - size: 3x1, position: 2,0, color: red
     differences:
       cells_changed: 9
       colors_changed: All colors are changed.  There's a specific mapping, similar to example_2.
     transformation:
       - A specific mapping of input colors to output colors.  5->1, 8->9, 6->2.  This mapping is different from example_2.

After reviewing all three examples, it's clear that the transformation is a color remapping.  There's no consistent arithmetic operation. Each example uses a different mapping.  This suggests the solution doesn't involve simple mathematical operations but rather a lookup table or a more complex rule based on the input colors.  The spatial arrangement of colors remains consistent; only the colors themselves change.  More examples might reveal a pattern in the mappings, or it might be a completely arbitrary mapping for each input configuration.
