**observations**



Here's an analysis of the provided example, aiming to identify the transformation rules:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (72)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3, 2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6, 7), color: blue
     output:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (63)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
         - 4: (4)
         - 7: (4)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3, 2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6, 7), color: blue
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3)], color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7)], color: orange

     differences:
       cells_changed: 8
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange.  Blue and Red remain in same positions.
     transformation:
       - The transformation appears to create a symmetric pattern around the existing red and blue cells.
       - Yellow blocks are added 2 cells above and below the red cell and orange blocks are added 2 cells to the right and below the blue cell.
       - The pattern is mirrored symmetrically (though not exactly, the orange block is one cell off from perfect symmetry).

**Initial Hypotheses:**

The transformation seems to involve adding new colored blocks symmetrically around existing colored cells.  The symmetry isn't perfect, suggesting possible variations in the rules depending on the position of existing colors or grid boundaries. Further examples are needed to confirm this and refine the rules.  The specific placement (2 cells away) and colors (yellow and orange) need further verification.

         - size: 2x2, positions: [(3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)], color: orange
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(6, 0), (6, 2), (7, 0), (7, 2)], color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(8, 0), (8, 2), (0, 5), (0, 7)], color: yellow


     differences:
       cells_changed: 16
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange. Blue and Red remain in the same positions. Azure remains in the same position.
     transformation:
       - Similar to example 1, yellow and orange blocks are added around existing colored cells.
       - The pattern is not perfectly symmetrical, potentially due to boundary conditions or other rules.
       - The addition of yellow and orange blocks around multiple colored cells at once.

**Revised Hypotheses:**

The transformation consistently involves adding yellow and orange blocks around existing colored cells (excluding white). The placement and quantity of these added blocks seem to be influenced by the positions of the pre-existing cells and the boundaries of the grid, resulting in an approximately, but not perfectly, symmetrical pattern.  The yellow blocks are predominantly placed to the upper and lower sides while the orange blocks are placed to the right and left.  However, this isn't absolute given boundary effects.

Further examples are needed to determine the precise rules for placement and handling of boundary conditions.  Additionally, whether the specific colors (yellow/orange) are fixed or vary based on other factors needs clarification.

       - Orange blocks are added around the blue cell.
       - The pattern is not perfectly symmetrical.

**Summary of Observations Across All Examples:**

The transformation consistently involves adding yellow and orange blocks around pre-existing colored cells (excluding white).  The placement isn't perfectly symmetrical; the proximity and arrangement seem influenced by the positions of the existing colored cells and the grid boundaries. Yellow tends to appear above and below, while orange appears to the sides, but this is not a strict rule.  The number of added blocks also varies depending on the surrounding area. The original colored blocks remain in their original positions.

**Refined Hypothesis:**

The transformation rule appears to be a conditional placement of yellow and orange blocks around non-white cells.  The placement is context-dependent, influenced by the location of the cell relative to the grid boundaries and other colored cells. A more precise rule set would require more examples to handle boundary conditions and the seemingly non-strict symmetry.  The algorithm would likely involve checking for the presence of neighboring cells and adding yellow and orange blocks based on proximity and boundary constraints.
