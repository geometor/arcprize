Here's an analysis of the provided example, aiming to identify the transformation rules:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (72)

         - 2: (1)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3, 2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6, 7), color: blue
     output:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (63)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
         - 4: (4)
         - 7: (4)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3, 2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6, 7), color: blue
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3)], color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7)], color: orange

     differences:
       cells_changed: 8
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange.  Blue and Red remain in same positions.
     transformation:
       - The transformation appears to create a symmetric pattern around the existing red and blue cells.
       - Yellow blocks are added 2 cells above and below the red cell and orange blocks are added 2 cells to the right and below the blue cell.
       - The pattern is mirrored symmetrically (though not exactly, the orange block is one cell off from perfect symmetry).

**Initial Hypotheses:**

The transformation seems to involve adding new colored blocks symmetrically around existing colored cells.  The symmetry isn't perfect, suggesting possible variations in the rules depending on the position of existing colors or grid boundaries. Further examples are needed to confirm this and refine the rules.  The specific placement (2 cells away) and colors (yellow and orange) need further verification.

     differences:
       cells_changed: 16
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange. Blue and Red remain in the same positions. Azure remains in the same position.
     transformation:
       - Similar to example 1, yellow and orange blocks are added around existing colored cells.
       - The pattern is not perfectly symmetrical, potentially due to boundary conditions or other rules.
       - The addition of yellow and orange blocks around multiple colored cells at once.

**Revised Hypotheses:**

The transformation consistently involves adding yellow and orange blocks around existing colored cells (excluding white). The placement and quantity of these added blocks seem to be influenced by the positions of the pre-existing cells and the boundaries of the grid, resulting in an approximately, but not perfectly, symmetrical pattern.  The yellow blocks are predominantly placed to the upper and lower sides while the orange blocks are placed to the right and left.  However, this isn't absolute given boundary effects.

Further examples are needed to determine the precise rules for placement and handling of boundary conditions.  Additionally, whether the specific colors (yellow/orange) are fixed or vary based on other factors needs clarification.

**Summary of Observations Across All Examples:**

The transformation consistently involves adding yellow and orange blocks around pre-existing colored cells (excluding white).  The placement isn't perfectly symmetrical; the proximity and arrangement seem influenced by the positions of the existing colored cells and the grid boundaries. Yellow tends to appear above and below, while orange appears to the sides, but this is not a strict rule.  The number of added blocks also varies depending on the surrounding area. The original colored blocks remain in their original positions.

**Refined Hypothesis:**

The transformation rule appears to be a conditional placement of yellow and orange blocks around non-white cells.  The placement is context-dependent, influenced by the location of the cell relative to the grid boundaries and other colored cells. A more precise rule set would require more examples to handle boundary conditions and the seemingly non-strict symmetry.  The algorithm would likely involve checking for the presence of neighboring cells and adding yellow and orange blocks based on proximity and boundary constraints.



**examples summary**



The transformation rule involves adding yellow (4) and orange (7) blocks around existing non-white cells in the input grid.  The placement of these blocks isn't perfectly symmetrical but rather context-dependent, influenced by proximity to the grid boundaries and other colored cells.  Let's break down the observed patterns:

**Placement of Yellow (4) Blocks:**


* Yellow blocks tend to appear above and below existing colored cells.  The exact number depends on whether there is space available (i.e., boundary conditions).
* The distance to the original colored cell is consistently 1 cell above/below.  If there is not enough space, yellow blocks are added to the opposite side.

**Placement of Orange (7) Blocks:**


* Orange blocks tend to appear to the left and right of existing colored cells.
* Similarly, a distance of one cell to the sides is maintained, adjusting for boundary limitations.

**Boundary Conditions:**

The algorithm appears to adapt to the grid boundaries, placing yellow and orange blocks only where space allows.  If a colored cell is near a boundary, the yellow or orange blocks are placed on the opposite side to maintain a roughly symmetric pattern.

**Algorithm Sketch (Python):**

This is a rudimentary sketch to illustrate the logic.  A more robust implementation would require careful handling of boundary conditions and possibly more sophisticated pattern matching.

The provided ``transform_grid`` function is a good starting point but doesn't perfectly replicate the observed outputs.  It's missing crucial logic for handling edge cases and the lack of perfect symmetry. The output is close, but there are several discrepancies comparing to the examples.  To improve accuracy, we need to refine the conditional logic.

Here's a revised approach, incorporating more robust boundary handling:

           for c in range(width):
               if input_grid[r, c] != 0:
                   # Yellow above and below, handling boundaries
                   if r > 0 and output_grid[r - 1, c] == 0:
                       output_grid[r - 1, c] = 4
                   elif r < height - 1 and output_grid[r + 1, c] == 0:
                       output_grid[r + 1, c] = 4
                   elif r == 0 and output_grid[r + 1, c] == 0:
                       output_grid[r + 1, c] = 4
                   elif r == height -1 and output_grid[r - 1, c] == 0:
                       output_grid[r-1, c] = 4


                   # Orange left and right, handling boundaries
                   if c > 0 and output_grid[r, c - 1] == 0:
                       output_grid[r, c - 1] = 7
                   elif c < width - 1 and output_grid[r, c + 1] == 0:
                       output_grid[r, c + 1] = 7
                   elif c == 0 and output_grid[r, c + 1] == 0:
                       output_grid[r, c + 1] = 7
                   elif c == width - 1 and output_grid[r, c - 1] == 0:
                       output_grid[r, c - 1] = 7

       return output_grid

   # Example Usage
   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

The refined ``transform_grid_refined`` function is still not perfect. While it handles boundary conditions better, the symmetry is still not consistently replicated.  The issue likely lies in the incomplete specification of the rule set; there may be more complex interactions between the placement of multiple coloured cells than initially assumed.  Additional examples would be needed to fully discern the rules and improve the algorithm's accuracy.  The current function produces an output closer to example 3, but still does not capture the full complexity of the transformation. To proceed further, I need more examples to identify the missing or more complex rules that explain the inconsistencies in the output.

     differences:
       cells_changed: 16
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange. Blue, red, azure, and magenta remain in the same positions.
     transformation:
       - The transformation adds yellow and orange blocks around existing colored cells.
       - The pattern appears to be approximately symmetrical, but the specific placement of yellow and orange blocks varies, potentially influenced by grid boundaries and the presence of other colored cells.

The ``transform_grid_refined`` function, while improved, still doesn't perfectly capture the transformation rules. The output shows some discrepancies compared to the expected output.  The core issue remains the incomplete specification of the rule set; the placement of yellow and orange blocks is not perfectly predictable based solely on proximity to the original colored cells and grid boundaries.  There's a higher-level pattern or interaction we haven't fully identified.  More examples are crucial to resolve this.
