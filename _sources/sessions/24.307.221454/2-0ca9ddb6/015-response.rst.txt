015 â€¢ Response
==============


The placement of orange (7) at (7,2) is questionable, and again highlights the limitations of the current approach. The pattern is far from clear, and attempts to manually fill in missing values is unreliable without a clearer understanding of the governing principles.

I reiterate that additional examples are needed to reveal the underlying logic behind the transformation. Manual pixel-by-pixel updates are highly inefficient and prone to errors without a more robust rule-based approach.  The current dataset is insufficient to derive a reliable algorithm.
