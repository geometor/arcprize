001 â€¢ Response
==============


Here's an analysis of the provided example, aiming to identify the transformation rules:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (72)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3, 2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6, 7), color: blue
     output:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (63)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
         - 4: (4)
         - 7: (4)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3, 2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6, 7), color: blue
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3)], color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7)], color: orange

     differences:
       cells_changed: 8
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange.  Blue and Red remain in same positions.
     transformation:
       - The transformation appears to create a symmetric pattern around the existing red and blue cells.
       - Yellow blocks are added 2 cells above and below the red cell and orange blocks are added 2 cells to the right and below the blue cell.
       - The pattern is mirrored symmetrically (though not exactly, the orange block is one cell off from perfect symmetry).

**Initial Hypotheses:**

The transformation seems to involve adding new colored blocks symmetrically around existing colored cells.  The symmetry isn't perfect, suggesting possible variations in the rules depending on the position of existing colors or grid boundaries. Further examples are needed to confirm this and refine the rules.  The specific placement (2 cells away) and colors (yellow and orange) need further verification.
