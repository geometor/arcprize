007 â€¢ Response
==============


The working output grid is initialized as a copy of the input grid. This is appropriate given that the transformation adds to the existing grid rather than replacing it.  The ``transform_grid_refined`` function attempts to capture the pattern of adding yellow and orange blocks around existing colored blocks, but the inconsistencies in the previous examples suggest a more complex rule set.  The function needs further refinement based on additional examples to correctly account for all observed behaviors.

To continue, I need either more examples or more information about the underlying rules that would allow me to create a function that correctly handles all cases.  The current function's output is partially correct, but the lack of perfect symmetry and the inconsistent application of yellow and orange blocks indicates incomplete understanding of the pattern.
