     input:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (68)
         - 1: (2)
         - 2: (2)
         - 8: (1)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3, 2), color: blue
         - size: 1x1, position: (7, 1), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6, 7), color: blue
         - size: 1x1, position: (2, 3), color: azure

     output:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (52)
         - 1: (2)
         - 2: (2)
         - 4: (4)
         - 7: (8)
         - 8: (1)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3, 2), color: blue
         - size: 1x1, position: (7, 1), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6, 7), color: blue
         - size: 1x1, position: (2, 3), color: azure
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(1, 5), (1, 7), (2, 5), (2, 7)], color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)], color: orange
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(6, 0), (6, 2), (7, 0), (7, 2)], color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(8, 0), (8, 2), (0, 5), (0, 7)], color: yellow


     differences:
       cells_changed: 16
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange. Blue and Red remain in the same positions. Azure remains in the same position.
     transformation:
       - Similar to example 1, yellow and orange blocks are added around existing colored cells.
       - The pattern is not perfectly symmetrical, potentially due to boundary conditions or other rules.
       - The addition of yellow and orange blocks around multiple colored cells at once.

**Revised Hypotheses:**

The transformation consistently involves adding yellow and orange blocks around existing colored cells (excluding white). The placement and quantity of these added blocks seem to be influenced by the positions of the pre-existing cells and the boundaries of the grid, resulting in an approximately, but not perfectly, symmetrical pattern.  The yellow blocks are predominantly placed to the upper and lower sides while the orange blocks are placed to the right and left.  However, this isn't absolute given boundary effects.

Further examples are needed to determine the precise rules for placement and handling of boundary conditions.  Additionally, whether the specific colors (yellow/orange) are fixed or vary based on other factors needs clarification.
