     differences:
       cells_changed: 16
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange. Blue, red, azure, and magenta remain in the same positions.
     transformation:
       - The transformation adds yellow and orange blocks around existing colored cells.
       - The pattern appears to be approximately symmetrical, but the specific placement of yellow and orange blocks varies, potentially influenced by grid boundaries and the presence of other colored cells.

The ``transform_grid_refined`` function, while improved, still doesn't perfectly capture the transformation rules. The output shows some discrepancies compared to the expected output.  The core issue remains the incomplete specification of the rule set; the placement of yellow and orange blocks is not perfectly predictable based solely on proximity to the original colored cells and grid boundaries.  There's a higher-level pattern or interaction we haven't fully identified.  More examples are crucial to resolve this.
