001 â€¢ Response
==============


Here's an analysis of the provided example, focusing on identifying the transformation from input to output:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 43
         - 8: 5
       objects:
         - size: 5x3, position: (1,1), color: azure
     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 42
         - 8: 5
         - 1: 2
       objects:
         - size: 5x3, position: (1,1), color: azure
     differences:
       cells_changed: 2
       colors_changed: Two 'azure' pixels changed to 'blue'
     transformation:
       - The transformation appears to involve changing some azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels. Specifically,  the  azure pixels at the top right corner and bottom left corner of the azure object are changed to blue.

**Reasoning:**

The core change is the replacement of two specific azure pixels with blue pixels. The locations of these changes seem related to the corners of the primary azure object. There's no obvious mathematical relationship or pattern besides this localized change.  Further examples are needed to determine if this is a consistent rule or a coincidence.
