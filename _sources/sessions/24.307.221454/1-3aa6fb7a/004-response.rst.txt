004 â€¢ Response
==============


Based on the analysis of the two examples, the transformation involves changing a subset of azure (8) pixels to blue (1). The selection of pixels to change isn't based on a simple geometric rule but seems to target pixels on the outer edges or periphery of azure clusters.  The number of pixels changed varies depending on the arrangement and size of the azure clusters.

Let's analyze the test input and predict the changes:



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                        [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                        [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   # Identify azure pixel locations
   azure_locations = np.where(test_input == 8)
   azure_pixels = list(zip(azure_locations[0], azure_locations[1]))

   # Manually identify candidate pixels for change based on the visual pattern from previous examples.  This is a heuristic, not a precise algorithm.
   candidate_pixels = [(0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (4, 3), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1)]

   # Create the output array, initialize from input.
   test_output = np.copy(test_input)

   # Change candidate pixels to blue.
   for row, col in candidate_pixels:
       test_output[row, col] = 1

   print("Predicted Output:")
   print(test_output)



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   Predicted Output:
   [[0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
    [1 8 0 0 0 0 1]
    [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 8 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 0]]



The code above identifies the azure pixels and then, based on the observed pattern in the examples, heuristically selects candidate pixels for conversion to blue.  It then generates the predicted output.  This is a heuristic approach because there's no mathematically precise rule derived from the examples to definitively identify which azure pixels should change.

Because the heuristic is based on visual observation of the previous examples, there's a degree of uncertainty, and the results may vary depending on the interpretation of the visual pattern. Therefore, this solution is a prediction based on limited evidence.  More examples would significantly improve the accuracy of the prediction.

**Submit**

The predicted output array ``test_output`` is:

.. code-block::

   [[0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
    [1 8 0 0 0 0 1]
    [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 8 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 0]]
