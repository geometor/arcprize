**observations**



Here's an analysis of the provided example, focusing on identifying the transformation from input to output:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 43
         - 8: 5
       objects:
         - size: 5x3, position: (1,1), color: azure
     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 42
         - 8: 5
         - 1: 2
       objects:
         - size: 5x3, position: (1,1), color: azure
     differences:
       cells_changed: 2
       colors_changed: Two 'azure' pixels changed to 'blue'
     transformation:
       - The transformation appears to involve changing some azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels. Specifically,  the  azure pixels at the top right corner and bottom left corner of the azure object are changed to blue.

**Reasoning:**

The core change is the replacement of two specific azure pixels with blue pixels. The locations of these changes seem related to the corners of the primary azure object. There's no obvious mathematical relationship or pattern besides this localized change.  Further examples are needed to determine if this is a consistent rule or a coincidence.

   example_2:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 43
         - 8: 7
       objects:
         - size: varies, position: scattered, color: azure
     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 40
         - 8: 7
         - 1: 3
       objects:
         - size: varies, position: scattered, color: azure
     differences:
       cells_changed: 3
       colors_changed: Three 'azure' pixels changed to 'blue'
     transformation:
       - Similar to example 1, azure pixels are changed to blue. The pattern appears to be replacing some, but not all, of the exterior azure pixels with blue pixels.  The selection isn't based on a simple geometric rule (like corners only).

**Reasoning and Combined Analysis of Examples 1 and 2:**

Both examples show a transformation where some, but not all, azure pixels are changed to blue.  The changed pixels appear to be on the "outer edges" or periphery of the clusters of azure pixels.  There's no clear, easily defined rule to predict *which* outer azure pixels will change,  other than their location relative to the main group of azure pixels.  A more complex pattern recognition or a machine learning approach might be needed to accurately identify which azure pixels are selected for transformation.  More examples are crucial to confirm or refine this hypothesis.



**examples summary**



The transformation rule appears to be the replacement of a subset of azure (8) pixels with blue (1) pixels.  The selection of which azure pixels to change isn't governed by a simple geometric rule (like corners or edges), but seems to involve pixels at the outer edges or periphery of clusters of azure pixels.

The number of azure pixels changed varies between examples. Example 1 changes 2 pixels, while Example 2 changes 3. This suggests there isn't a fixed number of pixels changed; rather, the number likely depends on the arrangement and size of the azure clusters.

To clarify the selection criterion, more examples are needed.  A possible approach for a more robust solution would involve feature engineering (e.g., creating features to represent a pixel's position relative to its neighbors) and using a machine learning model to predict which pixels should be changed.  A simpler rule-based system might not adequately capture the nuanced selection process.
