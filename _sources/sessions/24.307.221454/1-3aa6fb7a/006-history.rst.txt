**observations**



Here's an analysis of the provided example, focusing on identifying the transformation from input to output:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 43
         - 8: 5
       objects:
         - size: 5x3, position: (1,1), color: azure
     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 42
         - 8: 5
         - 1: 2
       objects:
         - size: 5x3, position: (1,1), color: azure
     differences:
       cells_changed: 2
       colors_changed: Two 'azure' pixels changed to 'blue'
     transformation:
       - The transformation appears to involve changing some azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels. Specifically,  the  azure pixels at the top right corner and bottom left corner of the azure object are changed to blue.

**Reasoning:**

The core change is the replacement of two specific azure pixels with blue pixels. The locations of these changes seem related to the corners of the primary azure object. There's no obvious mathematical relationship or pattern besides this localized change.  Further examples are needed to determine if this is a consistent rule or a coincidence.

   example_2:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 43
         - 8: 7
       objects:
         - size: varies, position: scattered, color: azure
     output:

       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 40
         - 8: 7
         - 1: 3
       objects:
         - size: varies, position: scattered, color: azure
     differences:
       cells_changed: 3
       colors_changed: Three 'azure' pixels changed to 'blue'
     transformation:
       - Similar to example 1, azure pixels are changed to blue. The pattern appears to be replacing some, but not all, of the exterior azure pixels with blue pixels.  The selection isn't based on a simple geometric rule (like corners only).

**Reasoning and Combined Analysis of Examples 1 and 2:**

Both examples show a transformation where some, but not all, azure pixels are changed to blue.  The changed pixels appear to be on the "outer edges" or periphery of the clusters of azure pixels.  There's no clear, easily defined rule to predict *which* outer azure pixels will change,  other than their location relative to the main group of azure pixels.  A more complex pattern recognition or a machine learning approach might be needed to accurately identify which azure pixels are selected for transformation.  More examples are crucial to confirm or refine this hypothesis.



**examples summary**



The transformation rule appears to be the replacement of a subset of azure (8) pixels with blue (1) pixels.  The selection of which azure pixels to change isn't governed by a simple geometric rule (like corners or edges), but seems to involve pixels at the outer edges or periphery of clusters of azure pixels.

The number of azure pixels changed varies between examples. Example 1 changes 2 pixels, while Example 2 changes 3. This suggests there isn't a fixed number of pixels changed; rather, the number likely depends on the arrangement and size of the azure clusters.

To clarify the selection criterion, more examples are needed.  A possible approach for a more robust solution would involve feature engineering (e.g., creating features to represent a pixel's position relative to its neighbors) and using a machine learning model to predict which pixels should be changed.  A simpler rule-based system might not adequately capture the nuanced selection process.

**observations**



Based on the analysis of the two examples, the transformation involves changing a subset of azure (8) pixels to blue (1). The selection of pixels to change isn't based on a simple geometric rule but seems to target pixels on the outer edges or periphery of azure clusters.  The number of pixels changed varies depending on the arrangement and size of the azure clusters.

Let's analyze the test input and predict the changes:



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                        [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                        [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   # Identify azure pixel locations
   azure_locations = np.where(test_input == 8)
   azure_pixels = list(zip(azure_locations[0], azure_locations[1]))

   # Manually identify candidate pixels for change based on the visual pattern from previous examples.  This is a heuristic, not a precise algorithm.
   candidate_pixels = [(0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (4, 3), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1)]

   # Create the output array, initialize from input.
   test_output = np.copy(test_input)

   # Change candidate pixels to blue.
   for row, col in candidate_pixels:
       test_output[row, col] = 1

   print("Predicted Output:")
   print(test_output)



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   Predicted Output:
   [[0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
    [1 8 0 0 0 0 1]
    [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 8 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 0]]



The code above identifies the azure pixels and then, based on the observed pattern in the examples, heuristically selects candidate pixels for conversion to blue.  It then generates the predicted output.  This is a heuristic approach because there's no mathematically precise rule derived from the examples to definitively identify which azure pixels should change.

Because the heuristic is based on visual observation of the previous examples, there's a degree of uncertainty, and the results may vary depending on the interpretation of the visual pattern. Therefore, this solution is a prediction based on limited evidence.  More examples would significantly improve the accuracy of the prediction.

**Submit**

The predicted output array ``test_output`` is:

    [0 0 0 1 8 0 0]
