**observations**



Here's an analysis of the provided example, focusing on identifying the transformation from input to output:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 43
         - 8: 5
       objects:
         - size: 5x3, position: (1,1), color: azure
     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 42
         - 8: 5
         - 1: 2
       objects:
         - size: 5x3, position: (1,1), color: azure
     differences:
       cells_changed: 2
       colors_changed: Two 'azure' pixels changed to 'blue'
     transformation:
       - The transformation appears to involve changing some azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels. Specifically,  the  azure pixels at the top right corner and bottom left corner of the azure object are changed to blue.

**Reasoning:**

The core change is the replacement of two specific azure pixels with blue pixels. The locations of these changes seem related to the corners of the primary azure object. There's no obvious mathematical relationship or pattern besides this localized change.  Further examples are needed to determine if this is a consistent rule or a coincidence.

     [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]]

     [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]]

**observations**



.. code-block:: yaml

   example_2:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 43
         - 8: 7
       objects:
         - size: varies, position: scattered, color: azure
     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 40
         - 8: 7
         - 1: 3
       objects:
         - size: varies, position: scattered, color: azure
     differences:
       cells_changed: 3
       colors_changed: Three 'azure' pixels changed to 'blue'
     transformation:
       - Similar to example 1, azure pixels are changed to blue. The pattern appears to be replacing some, but not all, of the exterior azure pixels with blue pixels.  The selection isn't based on a simple geometric rule (like corners only).

**Reasoning and Combined Analysis of Examples 1 and 2:**

Both examples show a transformation where some, but not all, azure pixels are changed to blue.  The changed pixels appear to be on the "outer edges" or periphery of the clusters of azure pixels.  There's no clear, easily defined rule to predict *which* outer azure pixels will change,  other than their location relative to the main group of azure pixels.  A more complex pattern recognition or a machine learning approach might be needed to accurately identify which azure pixels are selected for transformation.  More examples are crucial to confirm or refine this hypothesis.
