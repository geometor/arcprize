     output:

       colors:
         - 0: 40

       objects:
         - size: varies, position: scattered, color: azure
     differences:
       cells_changed: 3
       colors_changed: Three 'azure' pixels changed to 'blue'
     transformation:
       - Similar to example 1, azure pixels are changed to blue. The pattern appears to be replacing some, but not all, of the exterior azure pixels with blue pixels.  The selection isn't based on a simple geometric rule (like corners only).

**Reasoning and Combined Analysis of Examples 1 and 2:**

Both examples show a transformation where some, but not all, azure pixels are changed to blue.  The changed pixels appear to be on the "outer edges" or periphery of the clusters of azure pixels.  There's no clear, easily defined rule to predict *which* outer azure pixels will change,  other than their location relative to the main group of azure pixels.  A more complex pattern recognition or a machine learning approach might be needed to accurately identify which azure pixels are selected for transformation.  More examples are crucial to confirm or refine this hypothesis.
