   example_2:
     input:
       width: 10
       height: 8
       colors:
         - 0: 64
         - 5: 16
       objects:
         - size: 16, position: center-left, color: gray - An irregular gray shape.
     output:
       width: 10
       height: 8
       colors:
         - 0: 64
         - 8: 8
         - 2: 8
       objects:
         - size: 16, position: center-left, color: azure and red - The shape is largely maintained, with an inverse pattern of azure and red.
     differences:
       cells_changed: 16
       colors_changed: Gray pixels are replaced by azure and red pixels in a pattern mirroring the inverse of the gray shape.
     transformation:
       - Similar to example_1, the gray object is transformed into an azure and red object. The transformation maintains the shape but reverses the color pattern, with azure predominantly on the exterior and red on the interior, mimicking the gray shape's internal structure.

**Revised Thoughts and Pattern Speculation:**

Based on both examples:


#. 
   **Shape Preservation:** The transformation maintains the overall shape of the gray object.

#. 
   **Color Replacement:** Gray (5) is replaced by azure (8) and red (2).

#. 
   **Inverse Pattern:** The placement of azure and red pixels appears to be an inverse of the original gray shape's pattern.  Azure pixels tend to occupy the outer perimeter of the shape, while red pixels fill the inner areas.  This is a key observation that distinguishes this from a simple color substitution.

#. 
   **No clear mathematical function:** There isn't an immediately apparent mathematical function mapping the coordinates of gray pixels to azure and red pixels.  The "inversion" aspect suggests a more complex relationship.

Further examples are needed to confirm these observations and potentially uncover more subtle rules governing the precise arrangement of the azure and red pixels within the transformed object.  The relationship between the shape's concavity and the distribution of red and azure pixels warrants further investigation.
