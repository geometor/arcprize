**observations**



Here's an analysis of the provided example, focusing on identifying patterns and transformations:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 11
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 86
         - 5: 16
       objects:
         - size: 16, position: center, color: gray - A roughly rectangular blob of gray pixels.
     output:
       width: 11
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 86
         - 8: 8
         - 2: 8
       objects:
         - size: 8, position: center, color: azure - Roughly rectangular blob of azure pixels.
         - size: 8, position: center, color: red - Roughly rectangular blob of red pixels.
     differences:
       cells_changed: 24
       colors_changed: Gray pixels transformed into a combination of azure and red pixels.  The shape is somewhat maintained.
     transformation:
       - The central gray object is replaced with a similar-shaped object made up of azure and red pixels. Azure pixels seem to follow the outer shape of the gray object, and the red pixels appear to fill the interior.  There's an interesting 'inversion' or 'reversal' of how the colors are placed within the changed shape.

**Initial Thoughts and Pattern Speculation:**

The transformation appears to involve a replacement of the gray object. The new object has a similar overall shape, but its internal structure is different. The new object consists of two colors (azure and red) that seem to inversely fill the space of the original gray object's shape.  There might be a rule determining the precise arrangement of red and azure pixels, but more examples are needed to determine the relationship with certainty.  It's not a simple color replacement; the spatial arrangement matters.

   example_2:
     input:
       width: 10
       height: 8
       colors:
         - 0: 64
         - 5: 16
       objects:
         - size: 16, position: center-left, color: gray - An irregular gray shape.
     output:
       width: 10
       height: 8
       colors:
         - 0: 64
         - 8: 8
         - 2: 8
       objects:
         - size: 16, position: center-left, color: azure and red - The shape is largely maintained, with an inverse pattern of azure and red.
     differences:
       cells_changed: 16
       colors_changed: Gray pixels are replaced by azure and red pixels in a pattern mirroring the inverse of the gray shape.
     transformation:
       - Similar to example_1, the gray object is transformed into an azure and red object. The transformation maintains the shape but reverses the color pattern, with azure predominantly on the exterior and red on the interior, mimicking the gray shape's internal structure.

**Revised Thoughts and Pattern Speculation:**

Based on both examples:


#. 
   **Shape Preservation:** The transformation maintains the overall shape of the gray object.

#. 
   **Color Replacement:** Gray (5) is replaced by azure (8) and red (2).

#. 
   **Inverse Pattern:** The placement of azure and red pixels appears to be an inverse of the original gray shape's pattern.  Azure pixels tend to occupy the outer perimeter of the shape, while red pixels fill the inner areas.  This is a key observation that distinguishes this from a simple color substitution.

#. 
   **No clear mathematical function:** There isn't an immediately apparent mathematical function mapping the coordinates of gray pixels to azure and red pixels.  The "inversion" aspect suggests a more complex relationship.

Further examples are needed to confirm these observations and potentially uncover more subtle rules governing the precise arrangement of the azure and red pixels within the transformed object.  The relationship between the shape's concavity and the distribution of red and azure pixels warrants further investigation.

   example_3:
     input:
       width: 9
       height: 8
       colors:
         - 0: 64
         - 5: 12
       objects:
         - size: 12, position: center-left, color: gray - Irregular gray shape.
     output:
       width: 9
       height: 8
       colors:
         - 0: 64
         - 2: 6
         - 8: 6
       objects:
         - size: 12, position: center-left, color: red and azure - Shape largely maintained, inverse color pattern.
     differences:
       cells_changed: 12
       colors_changed: Gray pixels replaced by red and azure, maintaining the inverse pattern.
     transformation:
       - Similar to previous examples; gray object transformed into a red and azure object with shape preserved, but colors inversely distributed.  Azure predominantly at the 'center' of the object; red pixels occupy the more exterior portions compared to the original gray shape.

**Further Refined Thoughts and Pattern Speculation:**

The pattern continues to hold across all three examples.  The core transformation is:


#. 
   **Identify Gray Object:** Locate the connected group of gray (5) pixels.

#. 
   **Preserve Shape:** Maintain the overall shape and size of this gray object.

#. 
   **Inverse Color Mapping:** Replace gray pixels with a combination of red (2) and azure (8) pixels such that:


   * Red pixels tend to occupy positions that were closer to the exterior of the original gray object's shape.
   * Azure pixels tend to occupy positions that were closer to the interior of the original gray object's shape.

The "interior" and "exterior" are relative to the shape itself, not necessarily absolute grid positions. The transition seems to follow a rough gradient or boundary that separates the inside from the outside of the gray shape, but more examples are needed for more nuanced rules and exceptions.

There is no simple mathematical function apparent to directly translate pixel coordinates (x, y) of the gray object to the corresponding output color (2 or 8). The inverse mapping relationship is suggestive of a more sophisticated algorithm possibly involving a boundary detection and an inner/outer region classification.

To be certain, more examples are needed to define edge cases or exceptions that would allow for a full and robust definition of the algorithm's rules.
