001 â€¢ Response
==============


Here's an analysis of the provided example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 4
     height: 4
     colors:
       - 0: 11
       - 1: 1
       - 4: 2
       - 6: 1
       - 9: 1
     objects:
       - size: 1x1, position: (0,1), color: yellow
       - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: yellow
       - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: maroon
       - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: magenta
       - size: 1x1, position: (0,3), color: blue

   output:
     width: 4
     height: 4
     colors:
       - 0: 12
       - 1: 1
       - 4: 2
       - 6: 1
       - 9: 1
     objects:
       - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: yellow
       - size: 1x1, position: (3,3), color: maroon
       - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: magenta
       - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: blue
       - size: 1x1, position: (3,1), color: yellow


   differences:
     cells_changed: 7
     colors_changed: The non-zero colored pixels from the input appear in the bottom row of the output, while maintaining their relative positions to each other.  The rest of the output grid is filled with white.

   transformation:
     - The non-zero colored pixels are collected and placed in the bottom row of the output grid, maintaining their relative positions. The remaining cells are set to white.

The transformation appears to involve collecting all non-zero colored pixels from the input and placing them together in the bottom-right corner of the output grid, maintaining their relative positions to one another. The rest of the output is filled with white (0).
