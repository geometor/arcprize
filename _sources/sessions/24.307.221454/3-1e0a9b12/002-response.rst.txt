   differences:
     cells_changed: 6
     colors_changed: Non-zero elements are moved to the bottom row, maintaining relative position

   transformation:
     - Similar to example 1, non-zero elements are moved to the bottom row, maintaining their relative positions.  The difference appears to be that the bottom row is filled as much as possible before wrapping to the next row up.

The transformation in both examples involves moving the non-zero colored pixels to the bottom row of the output grid, preserving their relative positions.  The key difference between example 1 and example 2 is the handling of the non-zero pixels: Example 1 simply places them consecutively in the bottom row.  Example 2 seems to fill the bottom row as much as possible from left to right before moving up to the next row.  This could be interpreted as a filling from bottom-right, or a bottom row-first strategy, maximizing the bottom-right space used.

To be certain, more examples would be needed to distinguish between these hypotheses, and whether there are limits to the number of elements or to the size of the grid that may affect the transformation.  Additionally, it's worth testing the hypothesis that the transformation prioritizes the right-most elements in moving to the output.
