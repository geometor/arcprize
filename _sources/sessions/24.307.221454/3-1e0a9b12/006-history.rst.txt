   output:

     objects:
       - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: yellow
       - size: 1x1, position: (3,3), color: maroon
       - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: magenta
       - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: blue
       - size: 1x1, position: (3,1), color: yellow


   differences:
     cells_changed: 7
     colors_changed: The non-zero colored pixels from the input appear in the bottom row of the output, while maintaining their relative positions to each other.  The rest of the output grid is filled with white.

   transformation:
     - The non-zero colored pixels are collected and placed in the bottom row of the output grid, maintaining their relative positions. The remaining cells are set to white.

The transformation appears to involve collecting all non-zero colored pixels from the input and placing them together in the bottom-right corner of the output grid, maintaining their relative positions to one another. The rest of the output is filled with white (0).

       - size: 1x1, position: (5,5), color: azure


   differences:
     cells_changed: 6
     colors_changed: Non-zero elements are moved to the bottom row, maintaining relative position

   transformation:
     - Similar to example 1, non-zero elements are moved to the bottom row, maintaining their relative positions.  The difference appears to be that the bottom row is filled as much as possible before wrapping to the next row up.

The transformation in both examples involves moving the non-zero colored pixels to the bottom row of the output grid, preserving their relative positions.  The key difference between example 1 and example 2 is the handling of the non-zero pixels: Example 1 simply places them consecutively in the bottom row.  Example 2 seems to fill the bottom row as much as possible from left to right before moving up to the next row.  This could be interpreted as a filling from bottom-right, or a bottom row-first strategy, maximizing the bottom-right space used.

To be certain, more examples would be needed to distinguish between these hypotheses, and whether there are limits to the number of elements or to the size of the grid that may affect the transformation.  Additionally, it's worth testing the hypothesis that the transformation prioritizes the right-most elements in moving to the output.

   differences:
     cells_changed: 7
     colors_changed: Non-zero colored pixels are moved down to the bottom row, as far to the right as possible, maintaining relative positions.  The remaining cells are set to white (0).

   transformation:
     - The non-zero colored pixels are moved to the bottom row of the output grid, prioritizing the rightmost positions and maintaining their relative positions.  The rest of the output is filled with white.

Based on the three examples, the transformation consistently involves moving all non-zero colored pixels to the bottom row of the output grid while maintaining their relative positions. The key difference is the order in which the elements fill the row; the rightmost position is filled first, proceeding leftwards before moving to the row above it.  The remainder of the cells are filled with white.  The algorithm seems to read the non-zero elements from right to left, filling the bottom row from right to left, then moving up one row and proceeding similarly.



**examples summary**



The transformation rule consistently moves all non-zero colored pixels from the input grid to the bottom row of the output grid.  The order of placement within the bottom row is crucial: it proceeds from right to left, filling the rightmost available positions first before moving to the next position to the left. If the bottom row is filled, it moves to the row above and repeats the process. The remaining cells in the output grid are filled with white (0).

This behavior can be summarized as a "bottom-row-first, right-to-left fill" algorithm.  The algorithm's logic can be broken down into these steps:


#. **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid with a value other than 0.  Record their positions and values.
#. **Bottom-Row Fill:** Iterate through the identified pixels from right to left.
#. **Placement:** Place each pixel into the output grid in the bottom row.
#. **Row Overflow:** If there is no space in the bottom row (the rightmost column is already occupied), move to the row above and repeat step 3.
#. **Fill Remaining with White:** Fill the remaining cells in the output grid with 0 (white).

Let's illustrate this with a hypothetical 3x3 grid:

**Hypothetical Input:**

.. code-block::

   [[0, 1, 2],
    [3, 0, 0],
    [4, 5, 6]]

The non-zero pixels would be processed as follows: 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1.

**Resulting Output:**

.. code-block::

   [[0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0],
    [4, 5, 6]]

The provided code correctly implements the "bottom-row-first, right-to-left fill" algorithm.  The ``tool_outputs`` demonstrate that it accurately transforms the example grids as expected, confirming our hypothesis about the transformation rule.  The algorithm efficiently handles different grid sizes and numbers of non-zero pixels.

   differences:
     cells_changed: 15
     colors_changed: All non-zero pixels are moved to the bottom two rows, filling from right to left, then moving up a row.
   transformation:
     - The transformation follows the previously established rule of moving non-zero pixels to the bottom rows, prioritizing the rightmost columns and proceeding leftward, then moving up to the next row.

The ``tool_outputs``  matches the prediction based on the transformation rule.  Therefore, the generated output is submitted as the solution.



**initialize the working output grid:**



====



INSTRUCTIONS:



use function_call to initialize the working output grid:




* initialize_output_from_input: good when examples show few differences between input and output




* initialize_output_by_size: create a fresh grid from size and color
