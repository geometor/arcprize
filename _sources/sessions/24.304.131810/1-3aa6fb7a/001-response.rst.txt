Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 6
objects:
  - A cluster of 8s forming a roughly L-shaped pattern.
```

**Output:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 42
  - 8: 6
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - The L-shaped cluster of 8s remains.
  - Two 1s appear, one above and to the right of a top-most 8 in the L-shape, and another below and to the right of the bottom-most 8 in the L-shape
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed: Two '0' cells changed to '1'.
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to add a blue (1) cell to the upper-right and lower-right corners of the cluster of azure (8) cells.  The transformation is focused on the spatial relationship between the existing azure (8) pixels.  There is no change to the azure (8) pixels themselves, only the addition of new blue (1) pixels.


**Ruminations:**

The transformation suggests a rule based on the location of the azure (8) pixels.  To generate hypotheses about the transformation rule, we need more examples to identify whether the pattern applies to different configurations of the azure (8) pixels (different sizes and shapes).  Further examples are needed to determine if there are limits to the size of the cluster before the rule stops applying.  It is possible that any clusters of azure (8) cells follow the same transformation rule, or that only specific patterns (shapes or sizes) result in the addition of blue (1) cells.
