The transformation involves adding blue (1) pixels to the input grid based on the location and configuration of azure (8) pixels.  The placement of the new blue (1) pixels seems to follow a pattern related to the adjacency and overall shape of the azure (8) cluster.


Let's summarize our observations:


**Key Observations:**

1.  **Addition of Blue Pixels:** The core transformation is the addition of blue (1) pixels.  These are *always* added to locations that are adjacent to existing azure (8) pixels.

2.  **Adjacency and Shape:** The *precise location* of the added blue (1) pixels depends on the shape and arrangement of the azure (8) cluster.  In example 1, the shape is roughly L-shaped and results in two blue (1) pixels added to the upper-right and lower-right of the shape. In example 2, the shape is roughly Z-shaped resulting in three blue (1) pixels. One is added to the upper right, one to the lower right, and one to the right side.  This suggests a relationship to both the adjacency and the overall geometry of the 8 cluster.

3.  **No Modification of Azure Pixels:** Existing azure (8) pixels remain unchanged.


**Hypotheses:**

A plausible hypothesis is that the transformation algorithm iterates through the azure (8) pixels and adds blue (1) pixels to specific adjacent locations based on the orientation and connectivity of the 8-cluster.  This implies a need for spatial reasoning and potentially algorithms that analyze adjacency and shape.

**Further Testing Required:**

More test cases are needed to confirm the hypothesis and to fully understand the rules governing the placement of blue (1) pixels. The following tests are recommended:

1.  **Variations in Cluster Shape:** Examples with different cluster shapes (e.g., I-shape, square, more complex shapes).

2.  **Size of Cluster:**  Examples with larger clusters of '8's to determine if the number of added '1's correlates with the cluster size or follows a more complex relationship.

3.  **Multiple Clusters:** Examples with multiple disconnected clusters of '8's to understand how the algorithm handles multiple clusters.

4.  **Cluster Orientation:**  Varying the orientation (rotation) of the '8' clusters to assess the algorithm's sensitivity to orientation.

    Number of cells changed: 2

The code analysis confirms our observations from the visual inspection. It quantifies the changes, showing that exactly two cells changed from 0 to 1 in example 1.  Similar analysis should be applied to example 2 and subsequent examples to further refine our hypothesis.  The pattern appears to be the addition of blue (1) pixels adjacent to the azure (8) pixels, with the exact locations dependent on the cluster's shape and adjacency.  We need more examples to solidify and generalize this hypothesis.
