**Example 2**

**Input:

**

```

width: 7

height: 7

colors:

  - 0: 43

  - 8: 9

objects:

  - A cluster of 8s forming a roughly Z-shaped pattern.

```

**Output:**

```

width: 7

height: 7

colors:

  - 0: 40

  - 8: 9

  - 1: 3

objects:

  - The Z-shaped cluster of 8s remains.

  - Three 1s appear, one to the upper-right, lower-right, and one to the right of a middle 8 in the Z shape.

```

**Differences:**

```

cells_changed: 3

colors_changed: Three '0' cells changed to '1'.

```

**Transformation:**

Similar to Example 1, the transformation adds blue (1) cells.  However, the placement differs. In this example, a blue cell is added to the upper-right, lower-right, and the side of the 8 cluster. The placement of the 1 cells seem to be related to spatial orientation and distribution of the 8 cells. This suggests that the algorithm iterates through the eight cells and identifies the potential positions based on adjacency.

**Ruminations (after two examples):**

The transformation appears to involve adding blue (1) pixels adjacent to the azure (8) pixels, specifically to the upper-right, lower-right, and right-hand side.  However, this rule needs more testing.  The shape of the '8' cluster seems to influence the exact positions where the '1' pixels are added.  It would be helpful to see examples with:

*   Different cluster sizes and shapes.

*   Clusters of '8's that are disconnected (multiple separate clusters).

*   Clusters of '8's that have different orientations.

Further examples are critical to establishing a comprehensive understanding of this transformation.  Hypotheses will need to account for the variability in placement of the '1' pixels depending on the shape and configuration of the '8' pixel clusters.  A robust solution may involve a geometric analysis to identify the most probable positions of the added pixels, accounting for adjacency and cluster shape.
