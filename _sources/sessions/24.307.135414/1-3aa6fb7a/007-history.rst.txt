**observations**

Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 6
objects:
  - cluster of 8s: size 6, position (1,1) to (4,3), color azure
```

**Output:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 42
  - 8: 6
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - cluster of 8s: size 6, position (1,1) to (4,3), color azure
  - 1s: positions (1,2), (4,4) color blue
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed: Two 'azure' pixels changed to 'blue' (value 1).  The changed pixels are adjacent to existing azure pixels and near the edges of the azure cluster
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve changing some of the azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels.  Specifically, it seems that the top right and bottom leftmost azure pixels next to a larger group of azure pixels, are changed to blue. It appears to be a simple positional change with no numerical or geometric pattern evident.  There are many potential interpretations of this change, and more examples would greatly aid in a more concise description.  We may be looking at simple pixel replacement, or something more complex.

To proceed, I need more examples to confirm or refine this hypothesis.  More diverse examples with different cluster sizes and positions are needed to determine if the rule is as described.

**observations**

**Example 2**

**Input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 7
objects:
  - cluster of 8s: size 7, position (2,3) to (6,6), color azure
```

**Output:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 40
  - 8: 7
  - 1: 3
objects:
  - cluster of 8s: size 7, position (2,3) to (6,6), color azure
  - 1s: positions (1,5), (2,4), (5,4), color blue
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 3
colors_changed: Three 'azure' pixels changed to 'blue' (value 1). The changed pixels are located at the edges of the cluster.  Each change has a white cell adjacent,
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation is consistent with Example 1. It appears that some azure (value 8) pixels are changed to blue (value 1).  The pixels that change are those located at edges of the cluster of azure pixels. The pattern seems to indicate that the change is applied to edge pixels, where it has at least one white (value 0) pixel as a neighbor.


**Revised Transformation Hypothesis:**

Based on the two examples, a more refined transformation hypothesis is:

1. **Identify clusters:** Identify all connected regions of azure (8) pixels.
2. **Find edge pixels:** For each cluster, determine the pixels at its edges—those pixels that have at least one neighboring pixel with value 0.
3. **Change to blue:** Change a subset of edge pixels to blue (1). The specific subset of edge pixels to change is not yet clearly defined from these two examples, but it appears to be a somewhat arbitrary choice based on which edge pixel(s) should be changed. More examples are needed to find a pattern describing which edge pixel(s) are converted to blue.



More examples are needed to fully determine the transformation rule and especially to determine if the pattern for choosing which edge pixels to change is deterministic or non-deterministic.  The examples so far are consistent with this hypothesis, but it is not yet conclusive.

**examples summary**

Based on the two examples, the transformation involves changing a subset of edge pixels within clusters of azure (value 8) pixels to blue (value 1).  The edge pixels are defined as those having at least one adjacent white (value 0) pixel.

The selection of *which* edge pixels to change to blue isn't fully defined by these two examples.  More examples are needed to determine if there's a deterministic rule or if the selection is arbitrary.  However, the examples suggest a bias towards changing edge pixels which sit at the top-left and/or bottom-right corners of the connected group.

To further investigate, I need more examples with varying cluster sizes, shapes, and positions.  This will help determine if there are patterns in the selection of edge pixels to modify.  Additional examples would also help determine if the number of pixels changed is related to the cluster size or shape.  For instance, larger clusters might have more edge pixels changed, or clusters of a certain shape might result in a predictable number of changes.

A python function could be designed to identify clusters, find their edge pixels, and potentially simulate the transformation given a more precise definition of the pixel selection process.  However, without further examples, such a function would be based on an incomplete, potentially inaccurate understanding of the transformation.

**observations**

Here's a report analyzing the provided test input and integrating the learnings from the previous examples.

**Test Input Analysis:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 36
  - 8: 11
objects:
  - cluster 1: size 2, position (0,5) to (0,6), color azure
  - cluster 2: size 2, position (1,0) to (1,1), color azure
  - cluster 3: size 2, position (6,0) to (6,1), color azure
  - cluster 4: size 1, position (2,0), color azure
  - cluster 5: size 2, position (4,4) to (4,5), color azure
  - cluster 6: size 2, position (5,0) to (5,1), color azure
  - cluster 7: size 2, position (6,0) to (6,1), color azure
  - cluster 8: size 1, position (3,3), color azure

```

The input grid shows multiple clusters of azure (8) pixels, some of which are singletons, and others are pairs.  The sizes and locations of these clusters are diverse compared to the previous examples, providing a good test for the current hypothesis.


**Transformation Application and Prediction:**

Based on the refined hypothesis from the previous examples, we predict the following changes:

1. **Identify Edge Pixels:** Each cluster's edge pixels will be identified (those next to at least one white pixel).
2. **Change to Blue:** A subset of these edge pixels (typically corner pixels) will be changed to blue (1).  The exact selection process is still unclear.  But we'll assume (lacking a precise rule) we'll change the edge pixel(s) nearest the top-left and bottom-right corners of each cluster, respecting the observation that at least one adjacent white pixel is required.

**Predicted Output:**

Based on the above, I will attempt to create a predicted output. It will likely deviate from the correct solution if the rule for selecting which edge pixel to change is more complex.  The key to finding the ideal solution is to have more examples that guide us in this step of picking which edge pixels are converted.


**Python Code for Transformation (Illustrative):**

This code is incomplete because the exact logic for selecting which edge pixels to transform is not determined.  This function requires a refinement based on further examples.

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    
    def transform_grid(grid):
        #This section would need to be improved with a more precise rule for edge pixel selection
        #For now I'll approximate what appears to be true in previous examples.
        rows, cols = grid.shape
        output_grid = np.copy(grid)
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r, c] == 8:
                    #Check for adjacency with white pixels
                    is_edge = False
                    for dr, dc in [(0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0)]:
                        nr, nc = r+dr, c+dc
                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr, nc] == 0:
                            is_edge = True
                            break
                    if is_edge:
                        #Arbitrary rule: pick one pixel to change
                        output_grid[r,c]=1
    
        return output_grid
    
    test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                          [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                          [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    
    predicted_output = transform_grid(test_input)
    print(predicted_output)

code_execution_result: 1

```

The python code provides a predicted output based on a simplified interpretation of the rule.  A more sophisticated algorithm would be needed to precisely capture the subtle nuances in edge pixel selection shown in the examples.  The key limitation is the lack of a clearly defined rule for selecting which edge pixels are modified. More examples are crucial to formulate a more robust and accurate transformation function.  This function currently only considers direct adjacency to a white pixel to determine whether or not a pixel is on an edge.  Further examples might reveal that diagonal adjacency, or other factors, also play a role in edge pixel definition.

The working output grid is initialized correctly from the input grid.  The next step is to apply the transformation based on our current understanding, which requires refinement due to the ambiguity in selecting which edge pixels to change.

Let's review the code and refine it.  The current code simply changes *one* edge pixel if it finds an edge pixel in a cluster.  The examples might suggest it's actually converting corner pixels. Let's modify the code to attempt this.

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    
    def transform_grid(grid):
        rows, cols = grid.shape
        output_grid = np.copy(grid)
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r, c] == 8:
                    is_edge = False
                    for dr, dc in [(0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0)]:
                        nr, nc = r+dr, c+dc
                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr, nc] == 0:
                            is_edge = True
                            break
                    if is_edge:
                        #Attempt to find corner pixels
                        is_corner = False
                        corner_count = 0
                        for dr, dc in [(0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0)]:
                            nr, nc = r+dr, c+dc
                            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr, nc] == 0:
                                corner_count+=1
                        if corner_count >=2:
                            is_corner = True
                        if is_corner:
                            output_grid[r, c] = 1
        return output_grid
    
    test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                          [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                          [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    
    predicted_output = transform_grid(test_input)
    print(predicted_output)

code_execution_result: 1

```
[[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]

 [0 0 0 1 1 0 0]

```

The refined code attempts to identify corner pixels within the clusters of azure (8) pixels and changes those to blue (1).  This is still an approximation, as the exact selection rule remains elusive without more examples. The output from the refined code reflects this attempt.

Let's proceed with setting pixels in the working output grid based on this refined prediction, acknowledging the potential for error due to the incomplete understanding of the transformation rule.


function_call:
set_pixel(0,5,1)
set_pixel(0,6,1)
set_pixel(1,1,1)
set_pixel(1,6,1)
set_pixel(2,0,1)

set_pixel(4,4,1)
set_pixel(5,1,1)

     [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

    print(grid)

```

The working output grid now reflects the changes made based on the refined (but still potentially incomplete) transformation rule.  The grid closely matches the prediction generated by the improved `transform_grid` function.  However, without more examples, we cannot be entirely confident in its correctness.  Additional examples are needed to further refine the rule and potentially reveal additional subtleties in the pattern.  At this point, I would submit this as a solution given that we don't have additional information to refine the transformation.  There's a reasonable chance it's partially or fully incorrect due to the inherent ambiguity in the small sample size of provided examples.
