Based on the two examples, the transformation involves changing a subset of edge pixels within clusters of azure (value 8) pixels to blue (value 1).  The edge pixels are defined as those having at least one adjacent white (value 0) pixel.

The selection of *which* edge pixels to change to blue isn't fully defined by these two examples.  More examples are needed to determine if there's a deterministic rule or if the selection is arbitrary.  However, the examples suggest a bias towards changing edge pixels which sit at the top-left and/or bottom-right corners of the connected group.

To further investigate, I need more examples with varying cluster sizes, shapes, and positions.  This will help determine if there are patterns in the selection of edge pixels to modify.  Additional examples would also help determine if the number of pixels changed is related to the cluster size or shape.  For instance, larger clusters might have more edge pixels changed, or clusters of a certain shape might result in a predictable number of changes.

A python function could be designed to identify clusters, find their edge pixels, and potentially simulate the transformation given a more precise definition of the pixel selection process.  However, without further examples, such a function would be based on an incomplete, potentially inaccurate understanding of the transformation.
