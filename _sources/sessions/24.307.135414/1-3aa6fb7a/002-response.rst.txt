**Example 2**

**Input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 7
objects:
  - cluster of 8s: size 7, position (2,3) to (6,6), color azure
```

**Output:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 40
  - 8: 7
  - 1: 3
objects:
  - cluster of 8s: size 7, position (2,3) to (6,6), color azure
  - 1s: positions (1,5), (2,4), (5,4), color blue
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 3
colors_changed: Three 'azure' pixels changed to 'blue' (value 1). The changed pixels are located at the edges of the cluster.  Each change has a white cell adjacent,
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation is consistent with Example 1. It appears that some azure (value 8) pixels are changed to blue (value 1).  The pixels that change are those located at edges of the cluster of azure pixels. The pattern seems to indicate that the change is applied to edge pixels, where it has at least one white (value 0) pixel as a neighbor.


**Revised Transformation Hypothesis:**

Based on the two examples, a more refined transformation hypothesis is:

1. **Identify clusters:** Identify all connected regions of azure (8) pixels.
2. **Find edge pixels:** For each cluster, determine the pixels at its edges—those pixels that have at least one neighboring pixel with value 0.
3. **Change to blue:** Change a subset of edge pixels to blue (1). The specific subset of edge pixels to change is not yet clearly defined from these two examples, but it appears to be a somewhat arbitrary choice based on which edge pixel(s) should be changed. More examples are needed to find a pattern describing which edge pixel(s) are converted to blue.



More examples are needed to fully determine the transformation rule and especially to determine if the pattern for choosing which edge pixels to change is deterministic or non-deterministic.  The examples so far are consistent with this hypothesis, but it is not yet conclusive.
