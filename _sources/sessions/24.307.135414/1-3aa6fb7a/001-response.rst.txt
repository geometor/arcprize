Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 6
objects:
  - cluster of 8s: size 6, position (1,1) to (4,3), color azure
```

**Output:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 42
  - 8: 6
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - cluster of 8s: size 6, position (1,1) to (4,3), color azure
  - 1s: positions (1,2), (4,4) color blue
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed: Two 'azure' pixels changed to 'blue' (value 1).  The changed pixels are adjacent to existing azure pixels and near the edges of the azure cluster
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve changing some of the azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels.  Specifically, it seems that the top right and bottom leftmost azure pixels next to a larger group of azure pixels, are changed to blue. It appears to be a simple positional change with no numerical or geometric pattern evident.  There are many potential interpretations of this change, and more examples would greatly aid in a more concise description.  We may be looking at simple pixel replacement, or something more complex.

To proceed, I need more examples to confirm or refine this hypothesis.  More diverse examples with different cluster sizes and positions are needed to determine if the rule is as described.
