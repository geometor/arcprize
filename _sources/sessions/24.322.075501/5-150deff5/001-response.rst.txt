001 â€¢ Response
==============


The input grid shows a cluster of gray pixels arranged in an irregular shape.  The output grid shows a similar shaped cluster, but the gray pixels have been replaced with a combination of light blue and red pixels. The overall shape and size of the cluster remains consistent.  The light blue pixels seem to occupy the positions originally held by the majority of gray pixels, while red pixels are interspersed, particularly at the edges.

   differences:
     cells_changed: 21
     colors_changed: gray pixels replaced with light blue and red pixels.  The majority are light blue, with red pixels at the edges and interspersed within the light blue pixels.
   transformation:
     - The gray object is preserved in shape and size.
     - Gray pixels are replaced with light blue (8) pixels, primarily in the center of the object.
     - Red (2) pixels are added, mainly around the perimeter and scattered inside the object.

The transformation appears to involve a replacement of the gray pixels with a combination of light blue and red pixels while maintaining the overall shape of the original gray object.  The distribution of light blue and red suggests a possible rule based on proximity to the center or edges of the gray object in the input.
