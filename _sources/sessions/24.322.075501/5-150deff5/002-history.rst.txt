**observations**



The input grid shows a cluster of gray pixels arranged in an irregular shape.  The output grid shows a similar shaped cluster, but the gray pixels have been replaced with a combination of light blue and red pixels. The overall shape and size of the cluster remains consistent.  The light blue pixels seem to occupy the positions originally held by the majority of gray pixels, while red pixels are interspersed, particularly at the edges.

       - 5: 21
     objects:
       - size: 21, position: (1,2) to (6,7), color: gray

   output:
     width: 11
     height: 9
     colors:
       - 0: 73
       - 8: 12
       - 2: 9
     objects:
       - size: 21, position: (1,2) to (6,7), color: light_blue and red

   differences:
     cells_changed: 21
     colors_changed: gray pixels replaced with light blue and red pixels.  The majority are light blue, with red pixels at the edges and interspersed within the light blue pixels.
   transformation:
     - The gray object is preserved in shape and size.
     - Gray pixels are replaced with light blue (8) pixels, primarily in the center of the object.
     - Red (2) pixels are added, mainly around the perimeter and scattered inside the object.

The transformation appears to involve a replacement of the gray pixels with a combination of light blue and red pixels while maintaining the overall shape of the original gray object.  The distribution of light blue and red suggests a possible rule based on proximity to the center or edges of the gray object in the input.

INSTRUCTIONS:




* 
  Review Examples Phase

  pairs of input and output grids will be shown to you one at a time

  you will examine and analyze the text and image for each example

  you may use code execution with tools like numpy to examine patterns
  after examining the grids, document the attributes of each as such

  use a yaml block for the details

  .. code-block:: yaml

     input:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     output:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     differences:
       cells_changed: N
       colors_changed: desc
     transformation:
       - speculate on transformation rules

  your response for this phase should contain the following content parts


  * begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
    grid
  * run a ``code_execution`` part to test your perceptions - since the code you
    use may not be carried forward on following prompts, be sure to have the code print
    you findings in the output
    remember that you have access to many python libraries for analyzing the grids and validating patterns
  * review your findings and try to determine what the natural language program is for the transformation
