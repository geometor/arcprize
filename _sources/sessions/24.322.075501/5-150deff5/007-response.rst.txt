007 â€¢ Response
==============


The working output grid is currently identical to the input grid.  The transformation rules learned from the examples indicate that the gray pixels (5) should be replaced by light blue (8) and red (2) pixels, maintaining the overall shape. The light blue should be predominantly in the center, and the red around the edges.

Let's perform a transformation using a modified approach to more accurately reflect the observed pattern.  This approach will still have a degree of randomness, as the exact placement of red and blue pixels shows some inconsistency in the examples.  The goal is to find a balance between deterministic rules and the observed variations.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   import random

   def transform_grid(grid):
       rows, cols = grid.shape
       transformed_grid = np.copy(grid)
       gray_indices = np.where(grid == 5)
       gray_pixels = list(zip(gray_indices[0], gray_indices[1]))

       #calculate the center of mass of the gray pixels
       center_row = np.mean(gray_indices[0])
       center_col = np.mean(gray_indices[1])

       for row, col in gray_pixels:
           distance_to_center = np.sqrt((row - center_row)**2 + (col - center_col)**2)
           #probability of blue increases as it gets closer to the center
           probability_blue = 1 - distance_to_center / np.max(np.sqrt((gray_indices[0] - center_row)**2 + (gray_indices[1] - center_col)**2))
           probability_blue = max(0,min(1, probability_blue)) # keep probability between 0 and 1

           if random.random() < probability_blue:
               transformed_grid[row, col] = 8
           else:
               transformed_grid[row, col] = 2
       return transformed_grid


   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   transformed_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)
   print(transformed_grid)

    [0 0 0 0 0 8 2 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

This improved version considers the distance of each gray pixel from the center of mass of all gray pixels. The closer a pixel is to the center, the higher its probability of being transformed to light blue (8).  This creates a more gradual transition from light blue in the center to red on the edges.
