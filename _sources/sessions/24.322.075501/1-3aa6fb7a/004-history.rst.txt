**observations**



The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels forming a roughly rectangular shape.  The output grid is almost identical, except that two specific azure (8) pixels are changed to blue (1) pixels. These blue pixels are located at the bottom-right and top-right corners of the azure cluster.

**observations**



The input grid in example 2 shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels arranged in an irregular shape. The output grid is very similar, but some azure pixels have been replaced with blue (1) pixels.  The locations of the changes are again at the corners and edges of the azure cluster, suggesting a pattern related to the boundary of the cluster.

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: 3 azure pixels changed to blue.

   transformation:
     - Three azure pixels located at the edges of the azure cluster are replaced with blue pixels.

Based on the two examples, the transformation appears to be:  Identify clusters of azure (8) pixels.  Then, change some of the azure pixels at the edges or corners of the clusters to blue (1) pixels. The number of pixels changed seems to vary depending on the size and shape of the cluster.  There's no clear, consistent algorithm to precisely determine *which* edge pixels to change.  It's more of a visual, edge-detection based heuristic.



**examples summary**



The transformation involves identifying clusters of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.  Then, a subset of those azure pixels—specifically those located at or near the perimeter of the cluster—are changed to blue (1) pixels.  The number of azure pixels changed to blue appears to be related to the size and shape of the cluster, but there's no precise, predictable formula for determining exactly which pixels are modified. It's a heuristic transformation that depends on the visual characteristics of the azure pixel clusters.
