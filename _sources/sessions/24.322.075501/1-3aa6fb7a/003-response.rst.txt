The transformation involves identifying clusters of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.  Then, a subset of those azure pixels—specifically those located at or near the perimeter of the cluster—are changed to blue (1) pixels.  The number of azure pixels changed to blue appears to be related to the size and shape of the cluster, but there's no precise, predictable formula for determining exactly which pixels are modified. It's a heuristic transformation that depends on the visual characteristics of the azure pixel clusters.

       """Transforms the grid based on observed pattern."""

       # would need more sophisticated cluster analysis.

       # Iterate through clusters
       for label in range(1, num_features + 1):
           cluster_indices = np.where(labeled_grid == label)
           cluster_rows = cluster_indices[0]
