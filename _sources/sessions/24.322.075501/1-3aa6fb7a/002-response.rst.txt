002 â€¢ Response
==============


The input grid in example 2 shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels arranged in an irregular shape. The output grid is very similar, but some azure pixels have been replaced with blue (1) pixels.  The locations of the changes are again at the corners and edges of the azure cluster, suggesting a pattern related to the boundary of the cluster.

       - 8: 7
     objects:

   output:

     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 4
       - 1: 3
     objects:
       - size: 7, position: scattered, color: azure
       - size: 3, position: edges of azure cluster, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: 3 azure pixels changed to blue.

   transformation:
     - Three azure pixels located at the edges of the azure cluster are replaced with blue pixels.

Based on the two examples, the transformation appears to be:  Identify clusters of azure (8) pixels.  Then, change some of the azure pixels at the edges or corners of the clusters to blue (1) pixels. The number of pixels changed seems to vary depending on the size and shape of the cluster.  There's no clear, consistent algorithm to precisely determine *which* edge pixels to change.  It's more of a visual, edge-detection based heuristic.
