The input grid is a 3x7 grid with predominantly white (0) and blue (1) pixels,  featuring a vertical column of gray (5) pixels in the center. The output grid is a smaller 3x3 grid, almost entirely white (0), except for a single red (2) pixel in the center.



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0],
                         [0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1],
                         [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 2, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0]])

   print("Input Grid Shape:", input_grid.shape)
   print("Output Grid Shape:", output_grid.shape)
   print("Input Grid Unique Values:", np.unique(input_grid))
   print("Output Grid Unique Values:", np.unique(output_grid))
   print("Count of each value in input grid:", np.bincount(input_grid.flatten()))
   print("Count of each value in output grid:", np.bincount(output_grid.flatten()))



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   Input Grid Shape: (3, 7)
   Output Grid Shape: (3, 3)
   Input Grid Unique Values: [0 1 5]
   Output Grid Unique Values: [0 2]
   Count of each value in input grid: [11  7  0  0  0  3]
   Count of each value in output grid: [8 0 1]



Based on the analysis, the transformation appears to involve a significant reduction in grid size and a change in color. The central column of gray (5) pixels in the input seems to be related to the appearance of the single red (2) pixel in the output.  It's possible that the central column's presence triggers the appearance of a red pixel in a smaller, centrally located output grid. The specific positional relationship between the input gray column and the output red pixel needs further investigation with more examples.  There is no clear mathematical relationship between the numbers.

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 0: 11
       - 1: 7
       - 5: 3
     objects:
       - size: 3x1, position: center, color: gray
   output:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 0: 8
       - 2: 1
     objects:
       - size: 1x1, position: center, color: red
   differences:
     cells_changed: 20
     colors_changed: Gray(5) replaced by red(2) in a smaller grid
   transformation:
     - The central gray column in the input triggers a single red pixel in the center of a smaller output grid.  The rest is white.

INSTRUCTIONS:




* 
  Review Examples Phase

  pairs of input and output grids will be shown to you one at a time

  you will examine and analyze the text and image for each example

  you may use code execution with tools like numpy to examine patterns
  after examining the grids, document the attributes of each as such

  use a yaml block for the details

  .. code-block:: yaml

     input:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     output:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     differences:
       cells_changed: N
       colors_changed: desc
     transformation:
       - speculate on transformation rules

  your response for this phase should contain the following content parts


  * begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
    grid
  * run a ``code_execution`` part to test your perceptions - since the code you
    use may not be carried forward on following prompts, be sure to have the code print
    you findings in the output
    remember that you have access to many python libraries for analyzing the grids and validating patterns
  * review your findings and try to determine what the natural language program is for the transformation
