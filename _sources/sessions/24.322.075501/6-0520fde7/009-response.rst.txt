The current working output grid is incorrect.  My previous attempt to map the blue pixel distribution directly to the output grid was flawed, as it didn't sufficiently account for the limitations of the 3x3 output and the overall transformation pattern observed in the examples.

The key insight is that the number of adjacent blue pixels strongly correlates with the number of red pixels in the output.  The pattern of red pixels, however, isn't a direct replication of blue pixel positions but rather a representation of the *number* of blue pixels, often maintaining some level of symmetry within the 3x3 output.

Let's revisit the analysis and try a different approach.  We had 8 adjacent blue pixels.  Previous examples showed that when the number of adjacent blue pixels is close to the number of cells in the 3x3 output grid (9), the output tends towards a symmetric arrangement, or as close as possible given the constraint of the 8 red pixels.  Let's try to create a symmetric pattern with 8 red pixels.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   # Attempt to create a symmetric pattern with 8 red pixels in a 3x3 grid.
   output_grid = np.array([[2, 2, 2],
                          [2, 2, 2],
                          [2, 0, 2]])

   print(output_grid)
   np.count_nonzero(output_grid==2)

code_execution_result:

.. code-block::

   [[2 2 2]
    [2 2 2]
    [2 0 2]]
   8

This pattern uses 8 red pixels and maintains symmetry, which aligns well with the tendencies observed in previous examples.  It reflects the number of adjacent blue pixels without directly mirroring their positions.

:raw-html-m2r:`<start_of_image>`\ grid:

[[2 2 2]
 [2 2 2]
 [2 0 2]]

The resulting grid, [[2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2], [2, 0, 2]], is a strong candidate for the correct solution. It correctly reflects the eight adjacent blue pixels while maintaining symmetry.  The missing red is the central location.  This pattern aligns with the observed tendencies in previous examples.

The final predicted output grid is:

[[2 2 2]
 [2 2 2]
 [2 0 2]]
