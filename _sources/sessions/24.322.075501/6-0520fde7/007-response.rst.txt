007 â€¢ Response
==============


The current working output grid is a 3x3 grid filled with white (0) pixels.  My prediction, based on the analysis of previous examples and the high number (8) of blue pixels adjacent to the central gray column in the test input, is that the output grid should be completely filled with red (2) pixels.

Let's check my logic using code.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   # Test input grid
   input_grid = np.array([[1, 0, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1],
                         [0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 1],
                         [1, 0, 1, 5, 0, 1, 0]])

   # Predicted output grid (all red)
   predicted_output = np.full((3, 3), 2)

   # Function to count adjacent blue pixels
   def count_adjacent_blues(input_grid):
       gray_column_index = np.where(input_grid == 5)[1][0]
       adjacent_blues = 0
       for i in range(3):
           for j in [-1, 0, 1]:
               if 0 <= gray_column_index + j < 7 and input_grid[i, gray_column_index + j] == 1:
                   adjacent_blues += 1
       return adjacent_blues

   # Count adjacent blue pixels in test input
   num_adjacent_blues = count_adjacent_blues(input_grid)
   print(f"Number of adjacent blue pixels: {num_adjacent_blues}")

   # Check if prediction aligns with the rule (all adjacent blue pixels become red)
   if num_adjacent_blues == 9:  # Assuming a full 3x3 grid implies all adjacent blues are mapped to red.
       print("Prediction aligns with the rule (all red).")
   else:
       print("Prediction may not perfectly align with the rule.")

code_execution_result:

.. code-block::

   Number of adjacent blue pixels: 8
   Prediction may not perfectly align with the rule.

The code confirms that there are 8 adjacent blue pixels. My initial assumption that 9 adjacent blue pixels would result in a completely red 3x3 grid was incorrect.  However, the consistent pattern across previous examples is the transformation of adjacent blue pixels to red pixels.  Therefore, we should strive for a pattern that matches the arrangement of blue pixels around the central column.

Let's adjust the strategy.  We have 8 adjacent blue pixels.  A symmetric arrangement within a 3x3 grid would be difficult to achieve with 8 red pixels, requiring one white pixel. A more likely pattern, considering the previous examples' tendencies, would be a layout that tries to mimic the blue pixel distribution around the central gray column.  Let's try a pattern that places the reds in a way that reflects the input.  Given the symmetry and position of the blues in the input, the most logical pattern to maintain consistency would be placing the red pixels as follows:

[[2, 0, 2],
 [2, 2, 2],
 [2, 0, 2]]

This pattern respects symmetry and the distribution of the blues around the central gray column.

result:
set_range(x1=0, y1=0, x2=2, y2=2, color=2)
