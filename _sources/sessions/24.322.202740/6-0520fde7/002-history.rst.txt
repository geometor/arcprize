**observations**



The input grid is a 3x7 grid with predominantly white (0) and blue (1) pixels, and a single gray (5) column in the center. The output grid is a 3x3 grid with mostly white (0) pixels and a single red (2) pixel in the center.  The transformation appears to involve a significant reduction in size and a change in color of a single central element.



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0],
                         [0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1],
                         [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 2, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0]])

   print("Input Grid Shape:", input_grid.shape)
   print("Output Grid Shape:", output_grid.shape)
   print("Input Grid Unique Values and Counts:\n", np.unique(input_grid, return_counts=True))
   print("Output Grid Unique Values and Counts:\n", np.unique(output_grid, return_counts=True))

   #Find the location of the '5' in the input grid
   five_indices = np.where(input_grid == 5)
   print(f"Indices of 5 in input grid: {five_indices}")

   #Extract a 3x3 subgrid centered around the '5' in the input
   center_x = int(np.mean(five_indices[1]))
   center_y = int(np.mean(five_indices[0]))
   sub_grid_size = 3
   start_x = center_x - int(sub_grid_size / 2)
   start_y = center_y - int(sub_grid_size / 2)
   end_x = start_x + sub_grid_size
   end_y = start_y + sub_grid_size

   sub_grid = input_grid[start_y:end_y, start_x:end_x]
   print("Subgrid centered around '5':\n",sub_grid)

   Output Grid Unique Values and Counts:
    (array([0, 2]), array([8, 1]))

    [0 5 1]
    [0 5 0]]



.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 0: 11
       - 1: 7
       - 5: 3
     objects:
       - size: 3x1, position: center column, color: gray
       - size: varies, position: surrounding gray column, color: blue and white

   output:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 0: 8
       - 2: 1
     objects:
       - size: 1x1, position: center, color: red

   differences:
     cells_changed: 9
     colors_changed: Gray column replaced with a 3x3 grid, center cell changed to red

   transformation:
     - Reduce the input grid size to 3x3, centered on the column of '5's.
     - Replace the '5' in the center with a '2'.
     - Set all other cells to '0'.

The transformation involves identifying the central column of '5's in the input grid. A 3x3 subgrid is then extracted around this central column.  The '5' in the center of the subgrid is replaced with a '2', and all other cells within the 3x3 subgrid are set to '0'.  The resulting 3x3 grid forms the output.

INSTRUCTIONS:




* 
  Review Examples Phase

  pairs of input and output grids will be shown to you one at a time

  you will examine and analyze the text and image for each example

  you may use code execution with tools like numpy to examine patterns
  after examining the grids, document the attributes of each as such

  use a yaml block for the details

  .. code-block:: yaml

     input:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     output:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     differences:
       cells_changed: N
       colors_changed: desc
     transformation:
       - speculate on transformation rules

  your response for this phase should contain the following content parts


  * begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
    grid
  * run a ``code_execution`` part to test your perceptions - since the code you
    use may not be carried forward on following prompts, be sure to have the code print
    you findings in the output
    remember that you have access to many python libraries for analyzing the grids and validating patterns
  * review your findings and try to determine what the natural language program is for the transformation
