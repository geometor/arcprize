006 â€¢ Response
==============


Here's the report based on the provided input and the analysis of previous examples.

**Review Examples Phase**

The previous examples established a pattern of color mapping.  The input grid's colors are consistently remapped to different colors in the output grid, maintaining the spatial arrangement (column position). However, the mapping itself is not fixed; it varies between examples.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   def transform_grid(input_grid):
       """Transforms the input grid based on the observed color mapping."""
       color_mapping = {
           1: 5,  #blue to gray
           2: 6,  #red to magenta
           3: 4,  #green to yellow
           4: 3, #yellow to green
           5: 1, #gray to blue
           6: 2, #magenta to red
           8: 9, #azure to maroon
           9: 8  #maroon to azure

       }
       output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)  #Create a copy so we do not modify the original
       for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
           for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
               output_grid[i, j] = color_mapping[input_grid[i, j]]
       return output_grid

   #Example usage (test against the provided input):
   input_test_grid = np.array([[8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3]])
   output_test_grid = transform_grid(input_test_grid)
   print(f"Test Input:\n{input_test_grid}\nOutput:\n{output_test_grid}")

code_execution_result:

.. code-block::

   Test Input:
   [[8 1 3]
    [8 1 3]
    [8 1 3]]
   Output:
   [[9 5 4]
    [9 5 4]
    [9 5 4]]

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 8: 9
       - 1: 9
       - 3: 9
     objects:
       - size: 3x1, position: (0,0),(0,1),(0,2), color: azure, blue, green

   output:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 9: 9
       - 5: 9
       - 4: 9
     objects:
       - size: 3x1, position: (0,0),(0,1),(0,2), color: maroon, gray, yellow

   differences:
     cells_changed: 9
     colors_changed: All cells changed color according to a mapping.

   transformation:
     - The transformation involves a color mapping where each color in the input is replaced with a different color in the output. The mapping is determined by the function `transform_grid`, but the underlying rule that defines the mapping for any given example is still unknown, this is determined by inspecting past examples.

**Ruminate Phase**

From the examples, we've learned that the transformation always involves a unique color mapping for each instance. The mapping isn't predictable from the input alone. The spatial arrangement of colors remains constant.

The natural language program remains: "Each color in the input grid is transformed into a different color according to a specific mapping. This mapping varies from example to example but maintains column arrangement." The code (\ ``transform_grid``\ ) implements this but requires a hardcoded mapping (which needs to be derived by inspecting examples).

code_execution: (same as Review Examples Phase)

**Pre-Test Phase**

No additional information or examples are needed at this stage.  The function ``transform_grid`` with its current hardcoded mapping will be used to make a prediction for the test input.

**Test Phase**

The test input grid is [[8 1 3]
 [8 1 3]
 [8 1 3]].

Using the ``transform_grid`` function, we can predict the output.

code_execution: (same as Review Examples Phase)

The predicted output is [[9 5 4]
 [9 5 4]
 [9 5 4]].  This is based on the color mapping observed in the training examples.  Without a more general rule for determining the color mapping, this is the best prediction possible given the data.
