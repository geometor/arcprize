009 â€¢ Response
==============


The ``set_range`` function call is not defined, and its parameters are unclear.  To proceed, I need a clear definition of this function and its expected behavior in the context of transforming the grid.  Specifically, I need to know:


#. **What does ``set_range`` do?**  Does it modify a range of cells in the grid? If so, which cells and how? Does it replace cells with specific colors or values?
#. **What are the parameters?**  What do ``1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 2`` represent?  Are they coordinates, ranges, colors, or something else?

Once I have this information, I can execute the code and proceed to evaluate and update the working output grid according to the rule observed from previous examples.  Without this clarification, I cannot complete this step.
