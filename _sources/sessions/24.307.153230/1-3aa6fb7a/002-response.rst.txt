     differences:
       cells_changed: 3
       colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue. The changed pixels are isolated azure pixels, not adjacent to other azure pixels.
     transformation:
       - It appears that some, but not all azure pixels are changed to blue pixels. The transformation seems to involve a change in the color of specific azure pixels, possibly based on their location relative to other azure pixels.  Isolated azure pixels are changed to blue.

After reviewing both examples, the transformation rule seems to be:  **Isolated azure pixels (pixels that are not adjacent to other azure pixels, horizontally or vertically) are changed to blue.**

Let's test this hypothesis.  In example 1, the two isolated azure pixels are changed to blue. In example 2, three isolated azure pixels become blue.  This rule consistently explains the observed changes in both examples.
