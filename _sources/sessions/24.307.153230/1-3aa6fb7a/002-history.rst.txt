     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 42
         - 8: 5
         - 1: 2
       objects:
         - size: 5, position: (1,1), color: azure
     differences:
       cells_changed: 2
       colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue.  The changed pixels are adjacent to existing azure pixels.
     transformation:
       - It appears that some azure pixels are changed to blue pixels. The transformation seems to involve a change in the color of specific azure pixels, possibly based on their location relative to other azure pixels.  The specific rule is unclear from this single example.

The transformation appears to change some, but not all, azure pixels to blue pixels.  More examples are needed to determine the precise rule for selecting which azure pixels are changed.  The changed pixels are located at positions that are adjacent to other azure pixels.  A spatial relationship seems to be involved.
