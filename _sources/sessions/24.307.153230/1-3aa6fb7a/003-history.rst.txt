   example_1:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 43
         - 8: 5
       objects:
         - size: 5, position: (1,1), color: azure
     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 42
         - 8: 5
         - 1: 2
       objects:
         - size: 5, position: (1,1), color: azure
     differences:
       cells_changed: 2
       colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue.  The changed pixels are adjacent to existing azure pixels.
     transformation:
       - It appears that some azure pixels are changed to blue pixels. The transformation seems to involve a change in the color of specific azure pixels, possibly based on their location relative to other azure pixels.  The specific rule is unclear from this single example.

The transformation appears to change some, but not all, azure pixels to blue pixels.  More examples are needed to determine the precise rule for selecting which azure pixels are changed.  The changed pixels are located at positions that are adjacent to other azure pixels.  A spatial relationship seems to be involved.

   example_2:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 43
         - 8: 8
       objects:
         - size: 8, position: (0,4), color: azure
     output:

       colors:
         - 0: 40
         - 8: 8
         - 1: 3
       objects:
         - size: 8, position: (0,4), color: azure
     differences:
       cells_changed: 3
       colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue. The changed pixels are isolated azure pixels, not adjacent to other azure pixels.
     transformation:
       - It appears that some, but not all azure pixels are changed to blue pixels. The transformation seems to involve a change in the color of specific azure pixels, possibly based on their location relative to other azure pixels.  Isolated azure pixels are changed to blue.

After reviewing both examples, the transformation rule seems to be:  **Isolated azure pixels (pixels that are not adjacent to other azure pixels, horizontally or vertically) are changed to blue.**

Let's test this hypothesis.  In example 1, the two isolated azure pixels are changed to blue. In example 2, three isolated azure pixels become blue.  This rule consistently explains the observed changes in both examples.
