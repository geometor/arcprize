Okay, I've initialized the working output grid from the input grid.  The next step is to iteratively apply the transformation rule to change specific pixels in the grid.  I will use the `set_pixel` function repeatedly to accomplish this.


Before proceeding, let's verify that the `transform_grid` function accurately reflects the transformation rule and generates the predicted output.  I will run the function again and compare the result to the manually calculated predicted output.

code_execution:
```python
import numpy as np

def transform_grid(grid):
    """Transforms the input grid based on the observed pattern."""
    output_grid = np.copy(grid)
    eight_locations = np.where(grid == 8)
    eight_locations = list(zip(eight_locations[0], eight_locations[1]))

    for r, c in eight_locations:
        # Check adjacent cells
        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < grid.shape[1] and output_grid[nr, nc] == 0:
                output_grid[nr, nc] = 1
    return output_grid

test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                      [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

predicted_output = transform_grid(test_input)
print(predicted_output)

```
code_execution_result: 1
```
[[1 1 0 0 1 8 8]
 [8 8 1 0 0 1 8]
 [8 1 0 1 0 0 1]
 [1 0 1 8 1 0 0]
 [0 1 1 8 8 1 0]
 [1 8 1 1 1 0 0]
 [8 8 1 0 0 0 0]]
```

The output of `transform_grid` matches the predicted output calculated manually. This confirms the function correctly implements the hypothesis.  Now we can proceed with setting the pixels in the working output grid using this function.


function_call:
set_pixels(predicted_output)

result:
set_pixels(predicted_output)

updated with your changes
[[1 1 0 0 1 8 8]
 [8 8 1 0 0 1 8]
 [8 1 0 1 0 0 1]
 [1 0 1 8 1 0 0]
 [0 1 1 8 8 1 0]
 [1 8 1 1 1 0 0]
 [8 8 1 0 0 0 0]]

The working output grid now reflects the predicted output. All adjacent 0's to the 8's have been changed to 1's.  I am ready to submit this solution.
