Here's an analysis of example 2, followed by a revised hypothesis based on both examples:

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (41)
    *   8: (7)
*   objects:
    *   A fragmented cluster of 8s.


**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (38)
    *   8: (7)
    *   1: (3)
*   objects:
    *   The same fragmented cluster of 8s as the input, with three additional '1's added.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 3
*   colors_changed: Three '0' cells changed to '1' cells


**Transformation:**

Similar to example 1, '1' cells are added to the output. The pattern appears to be adding a '1' to the locations adjacent to, and immediately outside, the cluster of '8's. This pattern is not easily summarized by geometric rules.  These locations are one cell distant and directly above, below, left, or right of an '8'. The top and bottom rows (and therefore the left and rightmost columns) of the '8' cluster all show this pattern.


**Revised Hypothesis:**

Based on both examples, the transformation rule seems to be:

1.  Identify all cells containing the value '8'.
2.  For each '8' cell, check its immediate neighbors (horizontally and vertically adjacent).
3.  If a neighbor cell is a '0', change it to a '1'.

This accounts for the placement of the '1' cells in both examples.  This rule also suggests there is an implicit object boundary defined by the '8' cluster.


**Further Testing:**

To rigorously test this hypothesis, additional examples with different arrangements and cluster sizes of '8's are needed.  Examples with different input values and different cluster compositions will be required.  More complex input/output pairs will clarify if this hypothesis holds true.
