**observations**

Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (41)
    *   8: (5)
*   objects:
    *   A single cluster of 8s, starting at (1,1) and extending to (4,6)


**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (5)
    *   1: (2)
*   objects:
    *   A single cluster of 8s similar to the input, but with two 1s added; one at (1,2), and another at (4,4).


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 2
*   colors_changed: Two '0' cells changed to '1' cells


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding two '1' colored cells to the output grid.  The location of these additions is a bit ambiguous.  It seems to potentially relate to adding a blue "1" cell to the top-right and bottom-left corners of the main cluster of blue "8" cells.  Further examples would help to clarify this.

To solidify my understanding and test my hypothesis about the locations of the new "1" cells, I would need to analyze additional examples.  A more extensive analysis would enable me to determine if there is a clear mathematical or logical relationship between the input and output.
