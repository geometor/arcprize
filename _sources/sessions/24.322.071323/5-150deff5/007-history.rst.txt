**observations**



The input grid shows a cluster of gray (5) pixels arranged in an irregular shape resembling a slightly tilted, somewhat fragmented rectangle.  The output grid shows a similar-shaped cluster, but the gray pixels have been replaced with a combination of light blue (8) and red (2) pixels. The replacement pattern seems to maintain a mirror-like symmetry across a diagonal axis.

   transformation:
     - The gray object is replaced with a similar-shaped object comprised of light blue and red pixels. There appears to be a reflection or mirroring about an axis.  A more precise rule needs to be determined to account for the specific placement of blue and red pixels.

The transformation seems to involve a replacement of gray pixels with a combination of light blue and red pixels, preserving the general shape of the object.  The arrangement of blue and red pixels requires further analysis to define a precise transformation rule.  The code output shows the indices, which might help determine a pattern for the replacement.  It's possible the transformation is based on reflection or symmetry relative to a certain axis, but the exact rule remains unclear from a single example.  More examples are needed to refine the hypothesis.

**observations**



The input grid in example 2 displays a solid gray (5) shape resembling an inverted 'V' or a downward-pointing arrowhead. The output grid retains the same shape but replaces the gray pixels with a pattern of light blue (8) and red (2) pixels.  The pattern appears symmetrical and alternating.

The transformation in example 2 shows a clear pattern: the gray shape is maintained, and the gray pixels are replaced with alternating light blue and red pixels in a roughly symmetrical arrangement. The specific algorithm for placing the blue and red pixels requires further analysis, but the core transformation is readily apparent.

**observations**



The input grid in example 3 shows a gray (5) object that resembles a somewhat irregular, fragmented 'L' shape. The output grid maintains the same overall shape but replaces the gray pixels with light blue (8) and red (2) pixels.  The replacement pattern appears to be somewhat symmetrical but not strictly alternating.

     colors_changed: Gray (5) pixels replaced by a mix of light blue (8) and red (2) pixels.

   transformation:
     - The gray (5) object's shape is preserved.  The replacement of gray pixels with blue and red pixels is not strictly alternating or symmetrical, but there is a pattern, requiring more examples to define precisely.

The transformation in example 3 is similar to the previous examples in that the shape is preserved, but the color replacement pattern is less clearly defined.  More examples are needed to fully understand the rule.



**examples summary**



Based on the three examples, the transformation involves replacing gray (5) pixels with light blue (8) and red (2) pixels while maintaining the overall shape of the gray object.  The specific arrangement of blue and red pixels seems to depend on the shape and symmetry of the gray object.  It's not a simple alternating pattern, nor a strict mirroring, but a more complex relationship between the original gray pixels' positions and the final distribution of blue and red.  More data is needed to fully determine the algorithm.

The code above analyzes the index positions of gray pixels in the input and the corresponding light blue and red pixels in the output for all three examples.  The output shows that there isn't a simple, easily expressible mathematical relationship between these indices.  The transformation appears to be context-dependent, meaning the placement of blue and red pixels is relative to the overall shape and symmetry of the gray object in each example.  There's no clear axis of reflection or simple pattern that can be easily programmed.  More examples are needed to discern a more complex, perhaps rule-based transformation. A more sophisticated approach, possibly involving machine learning or pattern recognition techniques, might be required to model this transformation accurately.

**observations**



Based on the provided examples, the transformation involves replacing gray (5) pixels with a combination of light blue (8) and red (2) pixels while maintaining the overall shape of the gray object. The specific arrangement of blue and red pixels appears context-dependent and doesn't follow a simple, easily programmable pattern like strict alternation or mirroring.  Instead, the replacement seems influenced by the shape and symmetry of the gray object in each input.

To analyze the test input, let's first represent it as a NumPy array and then investigate its properties.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   test_input = np.array([
       [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ])

   print("Test Input Shape:", test_input.shape)
   print("Number of Gray Pixels:", np.count_nonzero(test_input == 5))
   gray_indices = np.where(test_input == 5)
   print("Indices of Gray Pixels:", gray_indices)

code_execution_result: 1

.. code-block::

   Test Input Shape: (8, 11)
   Number of Gray Pixels: 26
   Indices of Gray Pixels: (array([0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6]), array([2, 3, 5, 6, 2, 3, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 5, 6]))

The test input has 26 gray pixels arranged in a somewhat irregular shape.  The shape is reminiscent of the shapes in the training examples but more complex.  Based on the previous examples, I predict that these 26 gray pixels will be replaced with 26 pixels of light blue (8) and red (2), maintaining the overall shape.  However, the exact pattern of blue and red is difficult to predict with certainty without a more precise rule derived from additional examples.  The lack of a clear, easily expressed mathematical relationship between input and output pixel indices makes it challenging to automate the transformation.  More sophisticated pattern recognition techniques might be needed.

Without a more definitive rule, I can only offer a plausible, but potentially incomplete, output.  I will need more examples to refine the transformation rule.  My current approach would require a more detailed pattern matching algorithm than I can confidently implement without further data.

Given the limitations, I will provide a tentative output, assuming a symmetrical distribution of light blue and red similar to what was observed in the training examples.  This is a best guess and may not be perfectly accurate.

I will need additional examples or a more explicit description of the transformation rule to generate a guaranteed correct solution for the test puzzle.
