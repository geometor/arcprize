009 â€¢ Response
==============


The ``set_range`` function call correctly modified a rectangular region of the working output grid.  However, the placement was arbitrary and not based on a derived transformation rule. To proceed effectively, I need to either:


#. **Receive more examples:** Additional input-output pairs will help me discern the pattern governing the placement of blue and red pixels.
#. **Receive a description of the transformation rule:** A verbal or mathematical description of how the input grid transforms into the output grid will allow me to generate a precise and accurate solution.

Without either of these, any further modifications I make to the working output grid will remain speculative and are unlikely to result in a correct solution.  The tentative output generated earlier is already a best guess, but the actual output may differ significantly. The current approach of making arbitrary changes is unproductive.  Providing more examples or a rule description is crucial for achieving a successful solution.
