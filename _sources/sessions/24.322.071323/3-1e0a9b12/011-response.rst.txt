011 â€¢ Response
==============


Okay, I've reviewed the change.  Placing a 2 (red) at (4,1) in the working output grid is consistent with the downward shift transformation, filling the bottom row first.  The input grid likely contains a 2, and this is the next element added to the output grid following the rules.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   working_grid = np.array([[5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]])

   print("Working Grid:\n", working_grid)

code_execution_result: 1

.. code-block::

   Working Grid:
    [[5 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 2 0 0 0]]

The code execution confirms the updated working grid.  I'm ready for the next step.  My current hypothesis is that the algorithm fills the bottom row of the output first from left to right with the elements found from bottom to top and left to right in the input array.  Then, it moves to the second to bottom row and so on.  I will continue to refine this hypothesis as more steps are given.
