**observations**



The input grid is a 3x7 grid with blue (1), white (0), and gray (5) colors.  The blue pixels appear to form a somewhat irregular vertical column, with the gray (5) pixels forming a vertical column in the center. The output grid is a 3x3 grid containing mostly white (0) pixels, with a single red (2) pixel in the center.



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0],
                         [0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1],
                         [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 2, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0]])

   print("Input Grid Shape:", input_grid.shape)
   print("Output Grid Shape:", output_grid.shape)
   print("Input Grid Unique Values:", np.unique(input_grid))
   print("Output Grid Unique Values:", np.unique(output_grid))
   print("Count of each value in input grid:")
   for val in np.unique(input_grid):
       count = np.count_nonzero(input_grid == val)
       print(f"{val}: {count}")

   print("Count of each value in output grid:")
   for val in np.unique(output_grid):
       count = np.count_nonzero(output_grid == val)
       print(f"{val}: {count}")

.. code-block::

   Input Grid Shape: (3, 7)
   Output Grid Shape: (3, 3)
   Input Grid Unique Values: [0 1 5]
   Output Grid Unique Values: [0 2]
   Count of each value in input grid:
   0: 11
   1: 7
   5: 3
   Count of each value in output grid:
   0: 8
   2: 1



.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 0: 11
       - 1: 7
       - 5: 3
     objects:
       - size: 7x1, position: center, color: gray
       - size: varies, position: left and right, color: blue

   output:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 0: 8
       - 2: 1
     objects:
       - size: 1x1, position: center, color: red

   differences:
     cells_changed: 21
     colors_changed: input colors (0,1,5) changed to output colors (0,2)
   transformation:
     - The input grid is reduced in size.
     - The gray column is removed.
     - The blue pixels are replaced by white pixels.
     - A single red pixel appears in the center of the output grid.
     - The transformation seems to involve simplifying the image and highlighting a central element.

The transformation isn't immediately obvious.  It seems to involve a significant reduction in size, the removal of certain elements (the gray column), and the replacement of others (the blue columns become white). A single red pixel is added to the center in the output.  There's no clear mathematical relationship between the input and output values. More examples are needed to understand the rule.

INSTRUCTIONS:



instructions:


* 
  Review Examples Phase

  pairs of input and output grids will be shown to you one at a time

  you will examine and analyze the text and image for each example

  you may use code execution with tools like numpy to examine patterns
  after examining the grids, document the attributes of each as such

  use a yaml block for the details

  .. code-block:: yaml

     input:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     output:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     differences:
       cells_changed: N
       colors_changed: desc
     transformation:
       - speculate on transformation rules

  your response for this phase should contain the following content parts


  * begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
    grid
  * run a ``code_execution`` part to test your perceptions - since the code you
    use may not be carried forward on following prompts, be sure to have the code print
    you findings in the output
    remember that you have access to many python libraries for analyzing the grids and validating patterns
  * review your findings and try to determine what the natural language program is for the transformation
