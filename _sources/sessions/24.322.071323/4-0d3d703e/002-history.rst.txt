**Verbal Description:**

The input grid is a 3x3 grid containing three distinct colors: green (3), blue (1), and red (2), each color repeated three times in a column. The output grid is also a 3x3 grid, but with three different colors: yellow (4), gray (5), and magenta (6), each repeated three times in a column.  It appears that each color in the input grid is replaced by a different color in the output grid, in a consistent pattern across columns.

**Code Execution:**



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[3, 1, 2],
                         [3, 1, 2],
                         [3, 1, 2]])

   output_grid = np.array([[4, 5, 6],
                          [4, 5, 6],
                          [4, 5, 6]])

   print("Input Grid:\n", input_grid)
   print("\nOutput Grid:\n", output_grid)

   # Analyze color mappings
   unique_input_colors = np.unique(input_grid)
   unique_output_colors = np.unique(output_grid)

   color_mapping = {}
   for i in range(len(unique_input_colors)):
       color_mapping[unique_input_colors[i]] = unique_output_colors[i]

   print("\nColor Mapping:", color_mapping)

   # Verify mapping consistency
   consistent = True
   for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
       for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
           if output_grid[i, j] != color_mapping[input_grid[i, j]]:
               consistent = False
               break
       if not consistent:
           break

   print("\nMapping Consistent:", consistent)



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   Input Grid:
    [[3 1 2]
    [3 1 2]
    [3 1 2]]

   Output Grid:
    [[4 5 6]
    [4 5 6]
    [4 5 6]]

   Color Mapping: {np.int64(1): np.int64(4), np.int64(2): np.int64(5), np.int64(3): np.int64(6)}

   Mapping Consistent: False



**Review and Natural Language Program:**

The code reveals an inconsistency in my initial observation.  The mapping isn't a simple one-to-one replacement across the entire grid. While the code initially seemed to suggest a column-wise mapping (3->6, 1->4, 2->5),  the ``consistent`` flag being ``False`` indicates that's incorrect.  A closer inspection reveals a pattern:  each input color is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the natural language program could be described as: "For each cell in the input grid, add 1 to the cell's value to obtain the corresponding cell's value in the output grid.  Wrap around if the resulting value is greater than 6." The wrap-around is not evident in this example, but will be tested in future examples.

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 1: 3
       - 2: 3
       - 3: 3
     objects:
       - size: 3x1, position: (0,0), color: green
       - size: 3x1, position: (1,0), color: blue
       - size: 3x1, position: (2,0), color: red

   output:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 4: 3
       - 5: 3
       - 6: 3
     objects:
       - size: 3x1, position: (0,0), color: yellow
       - size: 3x1, position: (1,0), color: gray
       - size: 3x1, position: (2,0), color: magenta

   differences:
     cells_changed: 9
     colors_changed: All cells changed to new colors based on a +1 rule.

   transformation:
     - Add 1 to each cell's value.  (Potential wrap-around to be investigated in further examples)

INSTRUCTIONS:



instructions:


* 
  Review Examples Phase

  pairs of input and output grids will be shown to you one at a time

  you will examine and analyze the text and image for each example

  you may use code execution with tools like numpy to examine patterns
  after examining the grids, document the attributes of each as such

  use a yaml block for the details

  .. code-block:: yaml

     input:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     output:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     differences:
       cells_changed: N
       colors_changed: desc
     transformation:
       - speculate on transformation rules

  your response for this phase should contain the following content parts


  * begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
    grid
  * run a ``code_execution`` part to test your perceptions - since the code you
    use may not be carried forward on following prompts, be sure to have the code print
    you findings in the output
    remember that you have access to many python libraries for analyzing the grids and validating patterns
  * review your findings and try to determine what the natural language program is for the transformation
