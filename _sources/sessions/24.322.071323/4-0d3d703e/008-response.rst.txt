008 â€¢ Response
==============


The working output grid has been initialized to a 3x3 grid filled with 0s (white). This is appropriate since we are starting from scratch and don't want to carry over any information from the input grid, given the nature of the transformation (unique color mappings for each example).

**Code Execution (Analyzing the Initial Working Grid):**



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   working_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0]])

   print("Working Grid:\n", working_grid)
   print("\nShape:", working_grid.shape)
   print("\nUnique Values:", np.unique(working_grid))



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   Working Grid:
    [[0 0 0]
    [0 0 0]
    [0 0 0]]

   Shape: (3, 3)

   Unique Values: [0]



The code confirms that the working grid is a 3x3 array filled with zeros, as expected after the ``initialize_output_by_size`` call.  The next step is to use the identified color mapping to populate the working grid.  However, I need to improve the ``transform_grid`` function to reliably determine the mapping, considering the order of colors might vary between inputs and examples.
