**Review of ``set_range`` Operation:**

The ``set_range`` function call ``set_range(0.0, 0.0, 2.0, 0.0, 9)`` sets a rectangular region of the working grid to the value 9 (maroon).  The coordinates suggest that a 3x1 rectangle starting at (0,0) has been filled. This corresponds to the first column of the working grid. This is consistent with the observation that the color in the first column of the input (azure, 8) maps to maroon (9) in the example grids.

**Code Execution (Investigating Working Grid Properties):**

The following code examines the current state of the working grid:

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   working_grid = np.array([[9, 0, 0],
                           [9, 0, 0],
                           [9, 0, 0]])

   print("Working Grid:\n", working_grid)
   print("\nShape:", working_grid.shape)
   print("\nUnique Values:", np.unique(working_grid))

code_execution_result: 1

.. code-block::

   Working Grid:
    [[9 0 0]
    [9 0 0]
    [9 0 0]]

   Shape: (3, 3)

   Unique Values: [0 9]

The code shows that the working grid now contains two unique values: 0 (white) and 9 (maroon). The first column is correctly filled with 9, representing the mapping from azure (8) in the input to maroon (9) based on example 4.

**Next Steps:**

The next step is to fill the remaining columns of the working grid based on the color mapping derived from the examples. I will need to adapt the ``transform_grid`` function to accurately handle potential differences in the order of unique colors before proceeding.  A manual determination of the mapping based on comparing input colors with example mappings is currently the more reliable approach.

Based on example 4, the mapping seems to be 8 -> 9, 1 -> 4, 3 -> 6. So the next step would be to fill the rest of the columns based on this observation.

**update working grid**
function_call:
set_range

result:
set_range(0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 4)
**working output grid**

   [[9 4 0]
    [9 4 0]
    [9 4 0]]

The second column has now been correctly updated using ``set_range`` function based on the example 4 mapping.

**Code Execution (Investigating Working Grid Properties):**

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   working_grid = np.array([[9, 4, 0],
                           [9, 4, 0],
                           [9, 4, 0]])

   print("Working Grid:\n", working_grid)
   print("\nShape:", working_grid.shape)
   print("\nUnique Values:", np.unique(working_grid))

code_execution_result: 1

.. code-block::

   Working Grid:
    [[9 4 0]
    [9 4 0]
    [9 4 0]]

   Shape: (3, 3)

   Unique Values: [0 4 9]

The code shows that the working grid now contains three unique values: 0 (white), 4 (yellow), and 9 (maroon).  The first two columns are now correctly filled based on the mapping from the examples.

**update working grid**
function_call:
set_range

result:
set_range(0.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 6)
**working output grid**
updated with your changes

[[9 4 6]
 [9 4 6]
 [9 4 6]]

heatmap:

.. code-block::

   [[9 4 6]
    [9 4 6]
    [9 4 6]]

The final column has been updated, completing the grid.

**Code Execution (Investigating Working Grid Properties):**

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   working_grid = np.array([[9, 4, 6],
                           [9, 4, 6],
                           [9, 4, 6]])

   print("Working Grid:\n", working_grid)
   print("\nShape:", working_grid.shape)
   print("\nUnique Values:", np.unique(working_grid))

code_execution_result: 1

.. code-block::

   Working Grid:
    [[9 4 6]
    [9 4 6]
    [9 4 6]]

   Shape: (3, 3)

   Unique Values: [4 6 9]

The code shows that the working grid now contains three unique values: 4 (yellow), 6 (magenta), and 9 (maroon). The grid is complete and correctly reflects the predicted color mapping.
