Here's an analysis of example_1:

**example_1**

**input:**
  - width: 7
  - height: 7
  - colors:
    - 0: 43
    - 8: 6
  - objects:
    - A single cluster of 8s, somewhat resembling a rotated "L" shape.

**output:**
  - width: 7
  - height: 7
  - colors:
    - 0: 42
    - 8: 6
    - 1: 2
  - objects:
    - The same "L" shaped cluster of 8s persists.
    - Two additional pixels with the value 1 appear, adjacent to the 8s cluster.  One is at (1,2) and the other is at (4,5).

**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 2
  - colors_changed: Two '1' pixels added.  The addition of color 1 appears to replace a 0 in locations outside but adjacent to the main 8 cluster.


**transformation:**
  - The transformation appears to add two "1" pixels.  The locations of these "1" pixels are adjacent to the existing cluster of "8" pixels and on the outside of the cluster.  There appears to be no change to the existing "8"s.

**Rumination on the transformation:**

The transformation seems to involve identifying a cluster of a specific value (8 in this case) and then adding a new color (1) to cells that are adjacent to but outside the cluster.  Further examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis and to determine whether the selection of adjacent cells is deterministic or random.  The pattern is not fully clear from only one example.  More cases might reveal if there are any positional rules involved.
