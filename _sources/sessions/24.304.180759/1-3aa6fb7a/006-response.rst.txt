The working output grid is initialized correctly from the input grid.  The next step is to add the '1' pixels.  My strategy is to add them iteratively, checking adjacency to the '8' clusters and ensuring I'm placing them in '0' cells.  The code below implements this strategy.  I'll review the output after each addition.


code_execution:
```python
import numpy as np

output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                       [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                       [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

def set_pixel(grid, row, col, value):
    grid[row, col] = value

# Add '1' pixels iteratively, checking adjacency and available space

set_pixel(output_grid, 0, 5, 1) # Added

set_pixel(output_grid, 1, 6, 1) # Added

set_pixel(output_grid, 2, 0, 1) # Added

set_pixel(output_grid, 3, 3, 1) # Added

set_pixel(output_grid, 4, 3, 1) # Added

set_pixel(output_grid, 5, 1, 1) # Added

set_pixel(output_grid, 6, 0, 1) # Added


print(output_grid)
```
