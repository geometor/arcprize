**observations**

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**example_1**

**input:**
  - width: 7
  - height: 7
  - colors:
    - 0: 43
    - 8: 6
  - objects:
    - A single cluster of 8s, somewhat resembling a rotated "L" shape.

**output:**
  - width: 7
  - height: 7
  - colors:
    - 0: 42
    - 8: 6
    - 1: 2
  - objects:
    - The same "L" shaped cluster of 8s persists.
    - Two additional pixels with the value 1 appear, adjacent to the 8s cluster.  One is at (1,2) and the other is at (4,5).

**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 2
  - colors_changed: Two '1' pixels added.  The addition of color 1 appears to replace a 0 in locations outside but adjacent to the main 8 cluster.


**transformation:**
  - The transformation appears to add two "1" pixels.  The locations of these "1" pixels are adjacent to the existing cluster of "8" pixels and on the outside of the cluster.  There appears to be no change to the existing "8"s.

**Rumination on the transformation:**

The transformation seems to involve identifying a cluster of a specific value (8 in this case) and then adding a new color (1) to cells that are adjacent to but outside the cluster.  Further examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis and to determine whether the selection of adjacent cells is deterministic or random.  The pattern is not fully clear from only one example.  More cases might reveal if there are any positional rules involved.

**observations**

**example_2**

**input:**
  - width: 7
  - height: 7
  - colors:
    - 0: 43
    - 8: 9
  - objects:
    - A cluster of 8s forming a loose, irregular shape.

**output:**
  - width: 7
  - height: 7
  - colors:
    - 0: 40
    - 8: 9
    - 1: 3
  - objects:
    - The same cluster of 8s persists.
    - Three additional pixels with value 1 are added, all adjacent to the 8s cluster and outside it.


**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 3
  - colors_changed: Three '1' pixels added.  Similar to example 1, '1's are added adjacent to the 8's, but outside the cluster.

**transformation:**
  -  The transformation again adds pixels with the value "1" adjacent to the cluster of "8" pixels, and outside the cluster.  The positions of added "1" pixels appear to be consistently outside the main 8 cluster, and adjacent to it.

**Rumination after two examples:**

The pattern is becoming clearer. The transformation rule seems to be:

1. **Identify Clusters:** Find contiguous groups of pixels with value 8.
2. **Add Adjacent Pixels:** Add pixels with the value 1 to cells that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to the clusters of 8s, but not part of the cluster itself.  The number of added 1s appears to correspond to the number of edges in the cluster.

This hypothesis needs further testing, but it accurately describes both examples so far.  It's important to test with different cluster shapes and sizes.  The location of the added '1's might also depend on the shape and orientation of the 8 cluster.  Further tests should determine if there's a selection preference among available adjacent locations.

**examples summary**

- summarize your observations to explain the transformation of the input to output

- use code_execution to investigate properties, patterns and differences in the grids
