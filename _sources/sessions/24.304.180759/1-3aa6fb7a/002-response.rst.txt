**example_2**

**input:**
  - width: 7
  - height: 7
  - colors:
    - 0: 43
    - 8: 9
  - objects:
    - A cluster of 8s forming a loose, irregular shape.

**output:**
  - width: 7
  - height: 7
  - colors:
    - 0: 40
    - 8: 9
    - 1: 3
  - objects:
    - The same cluster of 8s persists.
    - Three additional pixels with value 1 are added, all adjacent to the 8s cluster and outside it.


**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 3
  - colors_changed: Three '1' pixels added.  Similar to example 1, '1's are added adjacent to the 8's, but outside the cluster.

**transformation:**
  -  The transformation again adds pixels with the value "1" adjacent to the cluster of "8" pixels, and outside the cluster.  The positions of added "1" pixels appear to be consistently outside the main 8 cluster, and adjacent to it.

**Rumination after two examples:**

The pattern is becoming clearer. The transformation rule seems to be:

1. **Identify Clusters:** Find contiguous groups of pixels with value 8.
2. **Add Adjacent Pixels:** Add pixels with the value 1 to cells that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to the clusters of 8s, but not part of the cluster itself.  The number of added 1s appears to correspond to the number of edges in the cluster.

This hypothesis needs further testing, but it accurately describes both examples so far.  It's important to test with different cluster shapes and sizes.  The location of the added '1's might also depend on the shape and orientation of the 8 cluster.  Further tests should determine if there's a selection preference among available adjacent locations.
