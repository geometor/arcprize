007 â€¢ Response
==============


The working output grid has been correctly initialized to a blank grid of the same size as the test input.  The next step is to apply the transformation logic, but as noted earlier, a more sophisticated approach than the simple radius-based method is needed for better accuracy in this test case.  The simple radius approach worked reasonably well on the smaller, simpler shapes of the example grids, but it is not robust enough for the more complex shape in the test input.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   #More sophisticated approach using connected component labeling.
   from skimage.measure import label, regionprops

   labeled_img = label(test_input)
   regions = regionprops(labeled_img)

   #Assuming the largest connected component is the one of interest:
   largest_region = max(regions, key=lambda region: region.area)
   largest_region_coords = largest_region.coords

   test_output = np.zeros_like(test_input)
   for coord in largest_region_coords:
       test_output[coord[0],coord[1]] = 8

   #Rudimentary fill (this is a very simplified approach to filling):
   #Improvement in this step is essential for better solutions.
   for row in range(test_output.shape[0]):
       for col in range(test_output.shape[1]):
           if test_output[row,col] == 0 and (
               ((row > 0 and test_output[row - 1, col] == 8) or
                (row < test_output.shape[0] - 1 and test_output[row + 1, col] == 8) or
                (col > 0 and test_output[row, col - 1] == 8) or
                (col < test_output.shape[1] - 1 and test_output[row, col + 1] == 8))
           ):
               test_output[row, col] = 2

   print("\nPredicted Output Grid (Improved):\n", test_output)

code_execution_result: 1

.. code-block::

   Predicted Output Grid (Improved):
    [[0 0 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 0 0]
    [0 0 2 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0]
    [0 2 2 2 8 8 2 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 8 8 2 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 2 8 8 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

The improved code uses connected component labeling to identify the main cluster more accurately, and then applies a simpler fill strategy.  However, the filling strategy is still rudimentary and could be improved significantly using more advanced image processing techniques, such as morphological operations (dilation, erosion, etc.).  The result here, however, is a better approximation of the expected transformation than the first attempt.  The filling of red pixels still needs improvement.

The improved approach using ``skimage`` provides a substantially better prediction of the output grid compared to the simple radius-based method.  The shape is better preserved and the filling of red around the azure cluster is more accurate.  However, perfect accuracy still eludes this approach.  Further refinement of the fill algorithm could improve the results.  The current filling strategy is highly sensitive to the input shape, and a more robust solution would be required to handle any arbitrary shape.
