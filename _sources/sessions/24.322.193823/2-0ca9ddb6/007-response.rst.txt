007 â€¢ Response
==============


The working output grid is correctly initialized as a copy of the input grid. This is the first step in applying the transformation rules. The code execution cell correctly identifies the coordinates of the red and blue pixels and the counts of all the colors present in the input grid.  This information is crucial for applying the rules and predicting the final output.  No changes are made to the grid at this point, so it is consistent with the rules, which dictate only the addition of new pixels, not modification or removal of existing ones.
