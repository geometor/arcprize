**Review Examples Phase**

The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels forming a roughly rectangular shape.  The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the azure pixels adjacent to white pixels have been changed to blue (1) pixels. Specifically, the azure pixels at the edges of the cluster seem to be the ones affected.



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   diff = np.where(input_grid != output_grid)
   changed_cells = len(diff[0])
   print(f"Number of cells changed: {changed_cells}")

   print("Indices of changed cells:", diff)

   print("Values of changed cells in input grid:", input_grid[diff])

   print("Values of changed cells in output grid:", output_grid[diff])



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   Number of cells changed: 2
   Indices of changed cells: (array([1, 4]), array([2, 4]))
   Values of changed cells in input grid: [0 0]
   Values of changed cells in output grid: [1 1]



.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 42
       - 8: 6
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: center-left, color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 6
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: center-left, color: azure
       - size: 2, position: edges of azure cluster, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: Two azure (8) pixels changed to blue (1) pixels.
   transformation:
     - Azure pixels on the edges of the cluster next to white pixels are replaced by blue pixels.

**Natural Language Program Speculation:**

The transformation appears to involve identifying clusters of azure pixels and then replacing any azure pixel that is adjacent to a white pixel with a blue pixel.  The adjacency check should be done only for the pixels directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally).

INSTRUCTIONS:




* 
  Review Examples Phase

  pairs of input and output grids will be shown to you one at a time

  you will examine and analyze the text and image for each example

  you may use code execution with tools like numpy to examine patterns
  after examining the grids, document the attributes of each as such

  use a yaml block for the details

  .. code-block:: yaml

     input:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     output:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     differences:
       cells_changed: N
       colors_changed: desc
     transformation:
       - speculate on transformation rules

  your response for this phase should contain the following content parts


  * begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
    grid
  * run a ``code_execution`` part to test your perceptions - since the code you
    use may not be carried forward on following prompts, be sure to have the code print
    you findings in the output
    remember that you have access to many python libraries for analyzing the grids and validating patterns
  * review your findings and try to determine what the natural language program is for the transformation
