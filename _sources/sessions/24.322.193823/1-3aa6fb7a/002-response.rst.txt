002 â€¢ Response
==============


The input grid in example 2 again shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels.  The output grid is very similar, but several azure pixels bordering white pixels have been changed to blue (1) pixels.  The pattern appears consistent with the first example.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   diff = np.where(input_grid != output_grid)
   changed_cells = len(diff[0])
   print(f"Number of cells changed: {changed_cells}")
   print("Indices of changed cells:", diff)
   print("Values of changed cells in input grid:", input_grid[diff])
   print("Values of changed cells in output grid:", output_grid[diff])

code_execution_result:

.. code-block::

   Number of cells changed: 3
   Indices of changed cells: (array([1, 2, 5]), array([4, 3, 3]))
   Values of changed cells in input grid: [0 0 0]
   Values of changed cells in output grid: [1 1 1]

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 10
     objects:
       - size: 10, position: scattered, color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 37
       - 8: 10
       - 1: 3
     objects:
       - size: 10, position: scattered, color: azure
       - size: 3, position: edges of azure clusters, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: Three azure (8) pixels changed to blue (1) pixels.
   transformation:
     - Azure pixels on the edges of clusters next to white pixels are replaced by blue pixels.

The transformation remains consistent: Azure pixels adjacent to white pixels are changed to blue.  The adjacency is only considered for horizontal and vertical neighbors.
