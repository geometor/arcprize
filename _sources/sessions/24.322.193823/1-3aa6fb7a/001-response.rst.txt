**Review Examples Phase**

The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels forming a roughly rectangular shape.  The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the azure pixels adjacent to white pixels have been changed to blue (1) pixels. Specifically, the azure pixels at the edges of the cluster seem to be the ones affected.

.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   diff = np.where(input_grid != output_grid)
   changed_cells = len(diff[0])
   print(f"Number of cells changed: {changed_cells}")

   print("Indices of changed cells:", diff)

   print("Values of changed cells in input grid:", input_grid[diff])

   print("Values of changed cells in output grid:", output_grid[diff])

.. code-block::

   Number of cells changed: 2
   Indices of changed cells: (array([1, 4]), array([2, 4]))
   Values of changed cells in input grid: [0 0]
   Values of changed cells in output grid: [1 1]



.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 42
       - 8: 6
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: center-left, color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 6
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: center-left, color: azure
       - size: 2, position: edges of azure cluster, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: Two azure (8) pixels changed to blue (1) pixels.
   transformation:
     - Azure pixels on the edges of the cluster next to white pixels are replaced by blue pixels.

**Natural Language Program Speculation:**

The transformation appears to involve identifying clusters of azure pixels and then replacing any azure pixel that is adjacent to a white pixel with a blue pixel.  The adjacency check should be done only for the pixels directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally).
