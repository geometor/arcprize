007 â€¢ Response
==============


The working output grid has been initialized correctly as a 5x5 grid filled with zeros (white).  This is consistent with the transformation rule, which states that all cells not containing non-zero elements from the input grid should be filled with zeros in the output grid.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   working_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   print("Working Output Grid:\n", working_output)

   #Check if all elements are 0
   all_zeros = np.all(working_output == 0)
   print(f"\nAre all elements in the working output grid 0?: {all_zeros}")

code_execution_result:

.. code-block::

   Working Output Grid:
    [[0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0]]

   Are all elements in the working output grid 0?: True

The code confirms that the working output grid is correctly initialized with all elements set to 0.  This is the expected state before applying the transformation to relocate the non-zero elements from the input grid.  The next step would be to implement the logic to move the non-zero elements from the input grid to the correct positions in the working output grid according to the refined transformation rules.
