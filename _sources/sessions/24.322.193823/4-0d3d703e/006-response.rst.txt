**Review Examples Phase (continued)**

The test input grid is a 3x3 grid with azure (8), blue (1), and green (3) arranged in columns.  This resembles the structure of previous examples.  To predict the output, we need to identify the color mapping based on the provided examples.  Let's use code to analyze the mappings from the examples.

**Code Execution:**



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   example_mappings = {
       1: {3: 4, 1: 5, 2: 6},
       2: {2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9},
       3: {5: 1, 8: 9, 6: 2},
       4: {9: 8, 4: 3, 2: 6}
   }

   test_input = np.array([[8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3]])

   # Let's try to deduce a pattern.  This is challenging as there isn't a direct mathematical function.  We need to rely on the observed mappings.

   def find_mapping(test_input, example_mappings):
     """ Attempts to find a mapping based on examples """
     for ex_num, mapping in example_mappings.items():
       inverse_mapping = {v: k for k, v in mapping.items()} #construct inverse
       possible_output = np.zeros_like(test_input)
       for i in range(test_input.shape[0]):
         for j in range(test_input.shape[1]):
           possible_output[i,j] = inverse_mapping.get(test_input[i,j], test_input[i,j]) #default to original
       print(f"Attempting mapping from example {ex_num}: \n {possible_output}")


   find_mapping(test_input, example_mappings)



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   Attempting mapping from example 1: 
    [[8 1 3]
    [8 1 3]
    [8 1 3]]
   Attempting mapping from example 2: 
    [[8 1 3]
    [8 1 3]
    [8 1 3]]
   Attempting mapping from example 3: 
    [[8 5 3]
    [8 5 3]
    [8 5 3]]
   Attempting mapping from example 4: 
    [[9 1 4]
    [9 1 4]
    [9 1 4]]



**Findings:**

The code attempts to apply the inverse mappings from the examples to the test input.  None of the examples provide a direct mapping solution.  However, example 3 gives a partial mapping.

The lack of a perfect match highlights the unpredictable nature of the color mapping. It's not a simple arithmetic or geometric transformation but a unique mapping for each input.  We need a new approach. Let's try creating a new mapping based on the existing examples. Let's focus on the relationship between the colors in the input and output.

**Revised Approach:**

We can try to establish relationships between the colors. We notice that in all examples, the same input color never produces the same output color. The mapping is a bijection.  This means we could look for a consistent pattern of how color values change.

**Code Execution (Revised):**



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   def find_potential_mapping(input_grid, example_mappings):
       """Finds a potential mapping using differences and example mappings"""
       unique_input_colors = np.unique(input_grid)
       potential_mapping = {}

       for color in unique_input_colors:
           best_match = None
           min_difference = float('inf')
           for ex_num, mapping in example_mappings.items():
               for input_color, output_color in mapping.items():
                   difference = abs(color - input_color)
                   if difference < min_difference:
                       min_difference = difference
                       best_match = output_color

           potential_mapping[color] = best_match

       return potential_mapping

   test_input = np.array([[8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3]])
   example_mappings = {
       1: {3: 4, 1: 5, 2: 6},
       2: {2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9},
       3: {5: 1, 8: 9, 6: 2},
       4: {9: 8, 4: 3, 2: 6}
   }

   potential_map = find_potential_mapping(test_input, example_mappings)
   print(f"Potential Mapping: {potential_map}")


   #Apply the mapping
   def transform_grid(input_grid, mapping):
     """Applies a color mapping to a grid."""
     output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
     for color, new_color in mapping.items():
       output_grid[output_grid == color] = new_color
     return output_grid

   output_grid = transform_grid(test_input, potential_map)
   print(f"Predicted Output:\n {output_grid}")



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   Potential Mapping: {np.int64(1): 5, np.int64(3): 4, np.int64(8): 9}
   Predicted Output:
    [[9 5 4]
    [9 5 4]
    [9 5 4]]



**Analysis of Results:**

The revised code attempts to find a potential mapping by looking for the closest color match in the examples. While not perfect, it produces a plausible output. This approach acknowledges that the mapping isn't directly given but can be approximated based on the relationships observed in the examples.

**Final Prediction:**

Based on the potential mapping generated by the code, the predicted output grid is:

.. code-block::

   [[9 5 4]
    [9 5 4]
    [9 5 4]]

This prediction is based on the closest color mappings found in the examples, recognizing the inherent unpredictability of the puzzle's color transformation.  A more sophisticated approach might involve machine learning techniques to learn the underlying mapping function from the examples, but this approach provides a reasonable prediction given the constraints.
