**Example 3 Analysis**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (11)
    *   1: (6)
    *   5: (3)
*   objects:  Again, a central column of three '5's.  The surrounding '1's are arranged in a pattern different from Examples 1 and 2.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (7)
    *   2: (2)
*   objects: Two '2's, positioned at opposite corners.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 23
*   colors_changed:  Similar to previous examples;  smaller output grid with mostly '0's and some '2's.


**Transformation:**

Example 3 further refines our hypothesis.  The consistent presence of the central column of three '5's in the input, producing a 3x3 output, is still observed. However, the placement and quantity of '2's in the output seem less directly related to the total count of '1's and more to their *specific arrangement* relative to the '5's.

Let's analyze the arrangement of '1's in relation to their adjacency to the central column of '5's:

*   **Example 1:** More dispersed '1's, resulting in one central '2'.
*   **Example 2:**  More clustered '1's, resulting in three '2's in a cross pattern.
*   **Example 3:**  '1's are arranged such that they are adjacent to the '5's, on the top-left and bottom-right, resulting in two '2's in these corresponding corners of the output grid.


**Revised Hypothesis:**

The presence of three consecutive '5's in a vertical column in the input triggers a 3x3 output grid. The position of the '2's in the output grid corresponds to the positions of the '1's that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to the central column of '5's.  The number of '2's reflects the number of such adjacent '1's.  The '1's that are diagonally adjacent to the central column of '5's do not seem to impact the placement of the '2's in the output.

This revised hypothesis requires further testing with additional examples to verify its accuracy and handle potential edge cases.
