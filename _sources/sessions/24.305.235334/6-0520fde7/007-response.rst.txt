Okay, I understand. The `initialize_output_by_size` function has created a 3x3 grid filled with 0s. Now, let's proceed to set the pixels based on our analysis of the test input.


code_execution:
```python
import numpy as np

working_output = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)

# Set pixels based on adjacent '1's identified in previous code execution
working_output[0, 1] = 2
working_output[2, 1] = 2

print(working_output)
```
code_execution_result: 2
```
[[0 2 0]
 [0 0 0]
 [0 2 0]]
```
function_call:
set_pixel(row=0, col=1, color=2)

result:
set_pixel(row=0, col=1, color=2)
**working output grid**
updated with your changes
[[0 2 0]
 [0 0 0]
 [0 0 0]]


<start_of_image>rotated by 90 degrees
[[0 0 0]
 [2 0 0]
 [0 0 0]]


function_call:
set_pixel(row=2, col=1, color=2)

result:
set_pixel(row=2, col=1, color=2)
**working output grid**
updated with your changes
[[0 2 0]
 [0 0 0]
 [0 2 0]]


<start_of_image>rotated by 90 degrees
[[0 0 0]
 [0 0 2]
 [0 2 0]]

The working output grid now matches the prediction. I'm ready to submit.
