**Example 1 Analysis**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (11)
    *   1: (5)
    *   5: (3)
*   objects: A central column of three '5's, surrounded by a pattern of '1's and '0's

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (8)
    *   2: (1)
*   objects: A single '2' in the center.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 23
*   colors_changed: Input grid colors are replaced by a smaller grid with mostly '0's and a single '2'.  The size and shape of the output grid has also changed significantly.


**Transformation:**

The transformation is not immediately obvious. The input grid is much larger and has many more colors, while the output grid is smaller and much simpler.  There's no obvious relationship between the positions or counts of colors in the input and output.  A potential area to investigate is to see if the presence of the number '5' in the input triggers the generation of the '2' in the output.  More examples are needed to determine any systematic relationship.

I need more examples to understand the transformation rule.  The current example provides insufficient data to establish a pattern for prediction.

**Example 2 Analysis**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (11)
    *   1: (6)
    *   5: (3)
*   objects: Similar to Example 1, a central column of three '5's, but this time surrounded by a slightly different pattern of '1's and '0's. The '1's are more clustered.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (6)
    *   2: (3)
*   objects: Three '2's arranged in a cross pattern.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 23
*   colors_changed: Again, the input grid's colors are replaced. The output grid is smaller and contains a different arrangement of '2's compared to Example 1.


**Transformation:**

Comparing Example 1 and Example 2 reveals a potential pattern.  Both inputs contain a central column of three '5's. In both cases, the output is a 3x3 grid. The number of '2's in the output seems related to the arrangement of '1's surrounding the central '5's in the input.

*   **Example 1:**  '5's are surrounded by a more dispersed pattern of '1's, resulting in a single '2' in the output.
*   **Example 2:** '5's are surrounded by a more concentrated pattern of '1's, resulting in three '2's in the output.


**Hypothesis:** The presence of the central column of three '5's triggers the creation of a 3x3 output grid. The number and arrangement of '2's in the output grid depend on the pattern of '1's surrounding the central '5's in the input. More examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis and refine the rules governing the number and arrangement of '2's.  The specific rule for determining the placement of '2's needs further investigation.  It is possible that proximity or adjacency of the '1's to the '5's is relevant.

To proceed, I need more examples to solidify this hypothesis and confirm the presence of a general rule.
