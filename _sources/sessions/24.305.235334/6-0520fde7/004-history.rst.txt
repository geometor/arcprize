**Example 1 Analysis**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (11)
    *   1: (5)
    *   5: (3)
*   objects: A central column of three '5's, surrounded by a pattern of '1's and '0's

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (8)
    *   2: (1)
*   objects: A single '2' in the center.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 23
*   colors_changed: Input grid colors are replaced by a smaller grid with mostly '0's and a single '2'.  The size and shape of the output grid has also changed significantly.


**Transformation:**

The transformation is not immediately obvious. The input grid is much larger and has many more colors, while the output grid is smaller and much simpler.  There's no obvious relationship between the positions or counts of colors in the input and output.  A potential area to investigate is to see if the presence of the number '5' in the input triggers the generation of the '2' in the output.  More examples are needed to determine any systematic relationship.

I need more examples to understand the transformation rule.  The current example provides insufficient data to establish a pattern for prediction.

**Example 2 Analysis**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (11)
    *   1: (6)
    *   5: (3)
*   objects: Similar to Example 1, a central column of three '5's, but this time surrounded by a slightly different pattern of '1's and '0's. The '1's are more clustered.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (6)
    *   2: (3)
*   objects: Three '2's arranged in a cross pattern.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 23
*   colors_changed: Again, the input grid's colors are replaced. The output grid is smaller and contains a different arrangement of '2's compared to Example 1.


**Transformation:**

Comparing Example 1 and Example 2 reveals a potential pattern.  Both inputs contain a central column of three '5's. In both cases, the output is a 3x3 grid. The number of '2's in the output seems related to the arrangement of '1's surrounding the central '5's in the input.

*   **Example 1:**  '5's are surrounded by a more dispersed pattern of '1's, resulting in a single '2' in the output.
*   **Example 2:** '5's are surrounded by a more concentrated pattern of '1's, resulting in three '2's in the output.


**Hypothesis:** The presence of the central column of three '5's triggers the creation of a 3x3 output grid. The number and arrangement of '2's in the output grid depend on the pattern of '1's surrounding the central '5's in the input. More examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis and refine the rules governing the number and arrangement of '2's.  The specific rule for determining the placement of '2's needs further investigation.  It is possible that proximity or adjacency of the '1's to the '5's is relevant.

To proceed, I need more examples to solidify this hypothesis and confirm the presence of a general rule.

**Example 3 Analysis**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (11)
    *   1: (6)
    *   5: (3)
*   objects:  Again, a central column of three '5's.  The surrounding '1's are arranged in a pattern different from Examples 1 and 2.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (7)
    *   2: (2)
*   objects: Two '2's, positioned at opposite corners.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 23
*   colors_changed:  Similar to previous examples;  smaller output grid with mostly '0's and some '2's.


**Transformation:**

Example 3 further refines our hypothesis.  The consistent presence of the central column of three '5's in the input, producing a 3x3 output, is still observed. However, the placement and quantity of '2's in the output seem less directly related to the total count of '1's and more to their *specific arrangement* relative to the '5's.

Let's analyze the arrangement of '1's in relation to their adjacency to the central column of '5's:

*   **Example 1:** More dispersed '1's, resulting in one central '2'.
*   **Example 2:**  More clustered '1's, resulting in three '2's in a cross pattern.
*   **Example 3:**  '1's are arranged such that they are adjacent to the '5's, on the top-left and bottom-right, resulting in two '2's in these corresponding corners of the output grid.


**Revised Hypothesis:**

The presence of three consecutive '5's in a vertical column in the input triggers a 3x3 output grid. The position of the '2's in the output grid corresponds to the positions of the '1's that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to the central column of '5's.  The number of '2's reflects the number of such adjacent '1's.  The '1's that are diagonally adjacent to the central column of '5's do not seem to impact the placement of the '2's in the output.

This revised hypothesis requires further testing with additional examples to verify its accuracy and handle potential edge cases.

**examples summary**

- summarize your observations to explain the transformation of the input to output

- use code_execution to investigate properties, patterns and differences in the grids
