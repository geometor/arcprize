**example_3**

**input:**
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (71)
    - 1: (1)
    - 2: (1)
    - 6: (1)
  objects:
    - single red pixel at (2, 2)
    - single blue pixel at (7, 3)
    - single magenta pixel at (5, 6)

**output:**
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (63)
    - 1: (1)
    - 2: (1)
    - 4: (4)
    - 6: (1)
    - 7: (4)
  objects:
    - single red pixel at (2, 2)
    - single blue pixel at (7, 3)
    - single magenta pixel at (5, 6)
    - yellow pixels form a cross around the red pixel.
    - orange pixels form an 'L' shape around the blue pixel.

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 8
  colors_changed: Added yellow and orange pixels around red and blue pixels, respectively, using the same patterns as in previous examples.

**transformation:**
- The transformation remains consistent with the previous examples. Yellow pixels are added in a cross pattern around red pixels, and orange pixels are added in an 'L' shape around blue pixels.  The magenta pixel remains unchanged.


**Ruminate Phase (Updated)**

The transformation consistently adds yellow pixels in a cross pattern around red pixels and orange pixels in an 'L' shape around blue pixels.  Magenta pixels remain unchanged.  The size of the grid does not affect the transformation.  The transformation only applies to red and blue pixels; other colors are unaffected.  No interaction is observed between the added yellow and orange patterns.

This refined understanding suggests a relatively straightforward rule-based system for the transformation.  The next steps would involve formulating this rule in code and testing it on the test input grid.
