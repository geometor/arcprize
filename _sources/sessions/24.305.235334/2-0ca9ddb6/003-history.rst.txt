**example_1**

**input:**
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (71)
    - 1: (1)
    - 2: (1)
  objects:
    - single red pixel at (3, 2)
    - single blue pixel at (6, 6)

**output:**
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (63)
    - 1: (1)
    - 2: (1)
    - 4: (4)
    - 7: (4)
  objects:
    - single red pixel at (3, 2)
    - single blue pixel at (6, 6)
    - yellow pixels form a cross shape centered around the red pixel
    - orange pixels form an L shape around the blue pixel


**differences:**
  cells_changed: 8
  colors_changed: Added yellow and orange pixels around the red and blue pixels respectively.


**transformation:**
- The transformation appears to add new colored pixels around the existing pixels (red and blue) following specific patterns. The red pixel is surrounded by a cross of yellow pixels, and the blue pixel is surrounded by an 'L' shape of orange pixels.  The patterns appear somewhat arbitrary, and more examples would be needed to ascertain any underlying rules.

**example_2**

**input:**
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (68)
    - 1: (2)
    - 2: (2)
    - 8: (1)
  objects:
    - single azure pixel at (0, 3)
    - two red pixels at (3, 0) and (7, 0)
    - two blue pixels at (3, 2) and (6, 6)

**output:**
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (56)
    - 1: (2)
    - 2: (2)
    - 4: (6)
    - 7: (12)
    - 8: (1)
  objects:
    - single azure pixel at (0, 3)
    - two red pixels at (3, 0) and (7, 0)
    - two blue pixels at (3, 2) and (6, 6)
    - yellow pixels are added around the red and blue pixels in patterns similar to example 1.
    - many orange pixels surround the blue and red pixels, forming patterns more complex than example 1.

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 18
  colors_changed: Added yellow and orange pixels around the red and blue pixels, forming more complex patterns than in example 1.


**transformation:**
- Similar to example 1, the transformation adds yellow and orange pixels around existing pixels (red, blue, and azure).  The patterns are more complex and extensive than in the first example, however the surrounding pattern appears to be influenced by the proximity to other coloured pixels. More data is needed to define the algorithm fully.


**Ruminate Phase**

Based on the two examples, the transformation appears to involve adding yellow and orange pixels around existing colored pixels (red, blue, and azure). The patterns of the added pixels are not entirely consistent and seem context-dependent. The proximity of other colored pixels may influence the shape and extent of the added patterns.  To confidently define the transformation rules, more examples are needed to identify potential regularities. The surrounding pattern appears to use a combination of crosses and 'L' shapes for the yellow and orange pixels respectively. However, more complex shapes appear in example 2.
