**example_1**

**input:**
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (71)
    - 1: (1)
    - 2: (1)
  objects:
    - single red pixel at (3, 2)
    - single blue pixel at (6, 6)

**output:**
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (63)
    - 1: (1)
    - 2: (1)
    - 4: (4)
    - 7: (4)
  objects:
    - single red pixel at (3, 2)
    - single blue pixel at (6, 6)
    - yellow pixels form a cross shape centered around the red pixel
    - orange pixels form an L shape around the blue pixel


**differences:**
  cells_changed: 8
  colors_changed: Added yellow and orange pixels around the red and blue pixels respectively.


**transformation:**
- The transformation appears to add new colored pixels around the existing pixels (red and blue) following specific patterns. The red pixel is surrounded by a cross of yellow pixels, and the blue pixel is surrounded by an 'L' shape of orange pixels.  The patterns appear somewhat arbitrary, and more examples would be needed to ascertain any underlying rules.
