The transformation consistently adds yellow pixels in a cross pattern around red pixels (value 2) and orange pixels in an L-shape around blue pixels (value 1).  Other colors remain unchanged.  The patterns added are independent of each other; the presence of one does not influence the other. The size and shape of the cross and L shapes remain constant, regardless of the proximity of other colored pixels.

Let's summarize this transformation in a concise manner:

**Transformation Rule:**

1. **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels with value 2 in the input grid.
2. **Add Yellow Cross:** For each red pixel at coordinates (x, y), add yellow pixels (value 4) at (x-1, y), (x+1, y), (x, y-1), and (x, y+1), if those coordinates are within the grid boundaries.
3. **Identify Blue Pixels:** Locate all pixels with value 1 in the input grid.
4. **Add Orange L-shape:** For each blue pixel at coordinates (x, y), add orange pixels (value 7) at (x-1, y), (x+1, y), (x, y+1), and (x+1, y+1), if those coordinates are within the grid boundaries.

This rule accurately describes the transformation observed across all three examples.  No additional information is needed to formalize a solution.
