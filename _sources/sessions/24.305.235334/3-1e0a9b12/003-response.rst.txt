**Example 3**

**Input:**

*   width: 5
*   height: 5
*   colors:
    *   0: 19
    *   1: 2
    *   2: 1
    *   3: 3
    *   6: 1
*   objects: Multiple green (3), blue (1), red (2), and magenta (6) objects scattered throughout the grid.

**Output:**

*   width: 5
*   height: 5
*   colors:
    *   0: 22
    *   1: 2
    *   2: 1
    *   3: 3
    *   6: 1
*   objects: The same objects as input but moved to the bottom two rows, maintaining their relative positions.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 11
*   colors_changed: Non-zero colored objects are moved to the bottom two rows while maintaining their relative order from left to right, top to bottom.  Top three rows filled with white (0).

**Transformation:**

The transformation is consistent with the refined hypothesis from the previous examples.  Non-zero pixels are moved to the bottom rows while maintaining their order.  The number of rows used at the bottom is the minimum needed to accommodate all the non-zero pixels.

**Refined Hypothesis (Further Refinement):**

Based on all three examples, the transformation rule is:

1.  Identify all non-zero colored pixels in the input grid.
2.  Maintain the order of these non-zero colored pixels from left to right, top to bottom.
3.  Move all identified non-zero colored pixels to the bottom rows of the output grid, maintaining their relative order and using the minimum number of rows required.
4.  Fill the remaining cells in the output grid with white (0).

This hypothesis accurately describes the transformations observed in all three examples.  It accounts for the movement of objects, the preservation of relative positions, and the adaptive use of bottom rows based on the number of non-zero pixels.  The next step is to test this hypothesis with a new input grid.
