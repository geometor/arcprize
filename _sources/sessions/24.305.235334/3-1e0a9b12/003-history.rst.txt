**observations**

Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

*   width: 4
*   height: 4
*   colors:
    *   0: 10
    *   1: 1
    *   4: 2
    *   6: 1
    *   9: 1
*   objects:
    *   A yellow (4) object in the top right and bottom left corner.
    *   A blue (1) object in the bottom left corner.
    *   A magenta (6) object in the bottom middle.
    *   A maroon (9) object in the top right corner.

**Output:**

*   width: 4
*   height: 4
*   colors:
    *   0: 12
    *   1: 1
    *   4: 2
    *   6: 1
    *   9: 1
*   objects:
    *   A yellow (4) object at the bottom left.
    *   A blue (1) object at the bottom left.
    *   A magenta (6) object at the bottom right.
    *   A maroon (9) object at the bottom right.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: The non-zero colored objects have moved to the bottom row.  The top three rows are now filled with white (0) pixels.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve collecting all the non-zero colored objects and placing them at the bottom row of the grid.  The order of objects seems to be maintained from left to right (bottom left to bottom right). The rest of the grid is filled with white (0).

To confirm this hypothesis, more examples are needed.  It is necessary to evaluate whether the transformation behaves consistently across different input configurations (e.g., different number of objects, varying positions of initial colored objects, etc.).

     [4 0 7 8 0 0]
     [4 0 7 0 0 0]]

**observations**

Here's an analysis of example 2, followed by a refined hypothesis encompassing both examples:

**Example 2**

**Input:**

*   width: 6
*   height: 6
*   colors:
    *   0: 28
    *   4: 3
    *   7: 2
    *   8: 2
    *   9: 1
*   objects: Multiple yellow (4), orange (7), azure (8), and maroon (9) objects scattered throughout the grid.


**Output:**

*   width: 6
*   height: 6
*   colors:
    *   0: 30
    *   4: 3
    *   7: 2
    *   8: 2
    *   9: 1
*   objects: The same objects as the input, but now the bottom row contains all the non-zero colored objects.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 6
*   colors_changed: The non-zero colored objects from the input are moved to the last row in the output.  The rest of the grid is filled with white (0). The arrangement of objects is maintained.


**Transformation:**

The transformation is similar to example 1; however,  it appears the algorithm only moves non-zero colored objects from the input image to the bottom row of the output image, and the relative arrangement of these objects is retained from left to right.

**Refined Hypothesis:**

Based on both examples, the transformation rule appears to be:

1.  Identify all non-zero colored pixels in the input grid.
2.  Preserve the order (from left to right, top to bottom) in which these colored objects appear.
3.  Move all of these identified non-zero colored pixels to the bottom row of the output grid, maintaining their relative order.
4.  Fill all other cells in the output grid with white (0).

This hypothesis accounts for the movement of objects and the preservation of the relative positions of the non-zero colored pixels.  The next step is to test this hypothesis with a new input grid.
