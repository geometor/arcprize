Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

*   width: 4
*   height: 4
*   colors:
    *   0: 10
    *   1: 1
    *   4: 2
    *   6: 1
    *   9: 1
*   objects:
    *   A yellow (4) object in the top right and bottom left corner.
    *   A blue (1) object in the bottom left corner.
    *   A magenta (6) object in the bottom middle.
    *   A maroon (9) object in the top right corner.

**Output:**

*   width: 4
*   height: 4
*   colors:
    *   0: 12
    *   1: 1
    *   4: 2
    *   6: 1
    *   9: 1
*   objects:
    *   A yellow (4) object at the bottom left.
    *   A blue (1) object at the bottom left.
    *   A magenta (6) object at the bottom right.
    *   A maroon (9) object at the bottom right.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: The non-zero colored objects have moved to the bottom row.  The top three rows are now filled with white (0) pixels.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve collecting all the non-zero colored objects and placing them at the bottom row of the grid.  The order of objects seems to be maintained from left to right (bottom left to bottom right). The rest of the grid is filled with white (0).

To confirm this hypothesis, more examples are needed.  It is necessary to evaluate whether the transformation behaves consistently across different input configurations (e.g., different number of objects, varying positions of initial colored objects, etc.).
