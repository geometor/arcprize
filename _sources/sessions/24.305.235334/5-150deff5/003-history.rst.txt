**observations**

Here's an analysis of the provided example, focusing on identifying the transformation from input to output:

**Example 1 Analysis:**

**Input:**

*   **width:** 11
*   **height:** 9
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (72) white
    *   5: (20) gray
*   **objects:** A single, irregular gray blob centered in the grid.


**Output:**

*   **width:** 11
*   **height:** 9
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (72) white
    *   2: (14) red
    *   8: (20) azure
*   **objects:** The gray blob has been replaced by an azure blob of similar shape and size. Parts of the original gray blob have been replaced by red pixels near the bottom.  The number of azure and red pixels is equal.


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 20
*   **colors_changed:** Gray pixels are replaced by a combination of azure and red pixels.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve a replacement of the gray (5) color with a combination of azure (8) and red (2) pixels, while maintaining the overall shape of the object.  The replacement uses an equal number of azure and red pixels.  A more precise rule could be to replace each gray pixel with a 50/50 mixture of red and azure pixels, but not in a strictly alternating pattern. The position of the red pixels appears to be slightly shifted in relation to the original gray pixels.  Further examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

**Example 2 Analysis:**

**Input:**

*   **width:** 10
*   **height:** 8
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (60) white
    *   5: (20) gray
*   **objects:** A single, irregular gray blob roughly in the shape of an inverted "V".


**Output:**

*   **width:** 10
*   **height:** 8
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (60) white
    *   2: (10) red
    *   8: (20) azure
*   **objects:** The gray blob is replaced with a combination of azure and red pixels, maintaining the same shape.


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 20
*   **colors_changed:** Gray pixels (5) are replaced with azure (8) and red (2) pixels.


**Transformation:**

The transformation in this example is very similar to Example 1.  Gray pixels are replaced with approximately equal numbers of azure and red pixels.  The shape of the object is maintained.  The placement of the red and azure pixels seems somewhat arbitrary, but maintaining the general pattern of alternating pixels.


**Ruminate Phase:**

Based on the two examples, the transformation appears to involve the following steps:

1.  **Identify Gray Blob:**  The algorithm identifies contiguous regions of gray pixels (color 5).
2.  **Replace Gray Pixels:**  Each gray pixel is replaced with either azure (8) or red (2).
3.  **Maintain Shape:** The overall shape of the gray blob is preserved.  The replacement doesn't significantly alter the boundary.
4.  **Roughly Equal Replacement:** The number of azure and red pixels replacing the gray pixels seems roughly equal,  though there is no strict alternating pattern observed.

The rule doesn't seem to depend on the specific shape or size of the gray blob, only the connectedness of gray pixels. Additional examples are needed to test the robustness of this theory and to determine whether the balance between red and azure pixels is precisely 50/50 or approximate.  The algorithm also seems to involve some randomness or non-deterministic element in assigning the red and azure pixels since a clear ordering of their placement is absent.
