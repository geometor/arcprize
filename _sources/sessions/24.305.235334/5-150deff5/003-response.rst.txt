**Example 3 Analysis:**

**Input:**

*   **width:** 9
*   **height:** 8
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (56) white
    *   5: (18) gray
*   **objects:**  A single, irregular gray blob.


**Output:**

*   **width:** 9
*   **height:** 8
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (56) white
    *   2: (9) red
    *   8: (9) azure
*   **objects:** The gray blob is replaced by an azure and red blob of the same shape.


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 18
*   **colors_changed:** Gray (5) is replaced by approximately equal numbers of red (2) and azure (8).


**Transformation:**

Example 3 further supports the pattern identified in Examples 1 and 2. The transformation involves replacing gray pixels with roughly equal numbers of red and azure pixels, maintaining the original shape of the gray object.  The distribution of red and azure pixels continues to appear somewhat arbitrary.


**Ruminate Phase (Continued):**

The consistent pattern across all three examples strongly suggests the following algorithm:

1.  **Identify Connected Components:** Identify all connected components of gray (5) pixels.
2.  **Replace with Red/Azure:** For each gray pixel in each connected component, randomly replace it with either red (2) or azure (8) with roughly a 50/50 probability.  The randomness accounts for the lack of an obvious spatial pattern in the placement of red and azure pixels.
3.  **Maintain Shape:** The overall shape of each gray component is preserved.  The transformation doesn't add or remove pixels from the object's boundary.

This algorithm is robust because it explains the transformation for various shapes and sizes of gray blobs without depending on specific geometric properties or precise spatial relationships.  The apparent randomness in the color choice for each pixel makes the algorithm resistant to minor variations in the input pattern.  This is important, because it ensures consistent output even if the input undergoes slight alterations.


**Test Phase Preparation:**

Given the consistency of the transformation rules observed, we are ready for the test phase.  The primary challenge will be to implement a function that faithfully replicates the replacement of gray pixels with a roughly equal number of red and azure pixels while maintaining connectedness. This function will need to perform the following steps:

1.  **Identify Connected Components:** Find all connected components of gray pixels (5).
2.  **Random Replacement:**  For each gray pixel found in step 1, randomly choose to replace it with either red (2) or azure (8).
3.  **Update Output:**  The output grid will be updated accordingly.
