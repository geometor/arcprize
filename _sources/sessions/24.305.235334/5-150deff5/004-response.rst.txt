The transformation consistently involves replacing gray pixels (5) with a roughly equal mix of red (2) and azure (8) pixels while maintaining the original shape of the gray object.  There is no strict pattern in the placement of red and azure; it seems to be a random or pseudo-random 50/50 replacement.  The key aspects are:

1.  **Connected Component Identification:** The algorithm identifies connected regions of gray pixels.
2.  **Random Replacement:** Gray pixels are replaced with either red or azure with approximately equal probability.
3.  **Shape Preservation:** The overall shape of the gray region is maintained.

Let's summarize the observations in a table:

| Example | Input Gray Pixels | Output Red Pixels | Output Azure Pixels |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 20 | 10 | 10 |
| 2 | 20 | 10 | 10 |
| 3 | 18 | 9 | 9 |


The close-to-equal distribution of red and azure pixels supports the hypothesis of a random 50/50 replacement process.  The shape preservation suggests that the algorithm likely uses a connected component labeling technique to identify individual gray regions before performing the replacement.  This is a common image processing technique for analyzing and manipulating regions of similar pixel values.  No other significant patterns are readily discernible.
