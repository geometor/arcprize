**Example 2 Analysis**

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   2: 3
    *   3: 3
    *   8: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangular blocks of red, green, and azure.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   6: 3
    *   4: 3
    *   9: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangular blocks of magenta, yellow, and maroon.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed:  Similar to Example 1, each color is replaced with a different color.  The transformation is not a simple numerical increment.  The mapping is: red (2) -> magenta (6), green (3) -> yellow (4), azure (8) -> maroon (9).

**Transformation:**

The transformation is not simply adding 1, but rather a more complex mapping. Let's analyze the numerical differences between input and output colors:

*   2 (red) -> 6 (magenta): +4
*   3 (green) -> 4 (yellow): +1
*   8 (azure) -> 9 (maroon): +1

There's no immediately obvious pattern from these numerical differences.  However, if we inspect the color indices, we find there is a pattern:

- Input color index + 4 mod 10 for color 2 and color 8.
- Input color index + 1 mod 10 for color 3.

This suggest the transformation may not be a simple arithmetic operation on the pixel values but rather a modular arithmetic operation considering the total number of possible colors (10).  This will need further verification with more examples.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

The transformation involves a modular arithmetic operation (+1 mod 10 or +4 mod 10) on the input grid's color values to produce the output grid values, depending on the initial color.  The choice of offset (1 or 4) may depend on some property of the input color, but not immediately apparent from the provided examples. The spatial layout of the input grid is maintained.  More examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis and identify the conditions that determine the modular offset.


**Overall Observations after Two Examples:**

The transformation preserves the spatial arrangement of colors. The transformation involves changing each color to another color based on a complex mapping rather than a simple arithmetic operation on the pixel values.  The mapping seems to involve modular arithmetic, but the rules for determining the modular offset need further investigation with more examples.
