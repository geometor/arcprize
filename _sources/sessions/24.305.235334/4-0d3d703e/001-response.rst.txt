**Example 1 Analysis**

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   3: 3
    *   1: 3
    *   2: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangular blocks of green, blue and red.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   4: 3
    *   5: 3
    *   6: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangular blocks of yellow, gray, and magenta.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: Each color in the input is replaced with a color of a higher value.  The mapping appears to be a simple increment of 1 to each value (3 -> 4, 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3). However, this increment is not the actual color change, it is instead a shift in the values, which results in a different color.  The color mapping needs to be considered.  Using the `COLOR_MAP` provided, the transformation is: green (3) -> yellow (4), blue (1) -> gray (5), red (2) -> magenta (6).

**Transformation:**

*   The transformation appears to be a direct mapping of input colors to output colors based on an offset of +1 to each input color value, where the offset is taken relative to the color value.

**Hypothesis:**

The transformation involves a simple arithmetic operation on the input grid's cell values to produce the output grid values.  Specifically, the values seem to be incremented by 1. This increment is performed in the numerical representation of the color and then translated to the output color using the color mapping.  This maintains the spatial layout of the input grid.

To test this, we'll need additional examples.  Further examples would help to confirm or refute the transformation and possibly provide additional detail about the mapping of colors.
