**Example 3 Analysis**

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   5: 3
    *   8: 3
    *   6: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangular blocks of gray, azure, and magenta.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   1: 3
    *   9: 3
    *   2: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangular blocks of blue, maroon, and red.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: Gray (5) -> blue (1), azure (8) -> maroon (9), magenta (6) -> red (2).

**Transformation:**

Let's analyze the numerical differences and modulo operation:

*   5 (gray) -> 1 (blue): -4  (or +6 mod 10)
*   8 (azure) -> 9 (maroon): +1 (or +1 mod 10)
*   6 (magenta) -> 2 (red): -4 (or +6 mod 10)

This example adds further evidence to the hypothesis of a modular arithmetic transformation.  Colors with an even input value seem to undergo a +6 mod 10 transformation, while colors with an odd input value seem to undergo a +1 mod 10 transformation.

**Revised Hypothesis (incorporating Example 3):**

The transformation involves a modular arithmetic operation (+1 mod 10 or +6 mod 10) on the input grid's color values. The offset is determined by whether the input color value is even or odd.

*   If the input color value is even, add +6 mod 10.
*   If the input color value is odd, add +1 mod 10.

The spatial layout of the input grid is preserved.  This hypothesis needs further testing with more examples but seems strongly supported by the three examples provided so far.


**Overall Observations after Three Examples:**

The transformation consistently preserves the spatial arrangement of colors. The core transformation appears to be modular arithmetic, specifically:

*   Odd input color values: `(value + 1) % 10`
*   Even input color values: `(value + 6) % 10`

This rule needs to be tested against further examples before being considered definitive.  The lack of a clear visual or spatial pattern between the input and output necessitates a color-based transformation rule.

I am ready for the test phase.
