**Example 4 Analysis**

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   9: 3
    *   4: 3
    *   2: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangular blocks of maroon, yellow, and red.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   8: 3
    *   3: 3
    *   6: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangular blocks of azure, green, and magenta.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: Maroon (9) -> azure (8), yellow (4) -> green (3), red (2) -> magenta (6).

**Transformation:**

Let's analyze the numerical differences and modulo operation:

*   9 (maroon) -> 8 (azure): -1 (or +9 mod 10)
*   4 (yellow) -> 3 (green): -1 (or +9 mod 10)
*   2 (red) -> 6 (magenta): +4 (or +4 mod 10)


This example introduces a new complexity. The previous hypothesis doesn't fully explain this transformation. There's no consistent even/odd rule here. It appears that the transformation is still modular arithmetic, but the offset seems dependent on the specific input color.  


**Revised Hypothesis (incorporating Example 4):**

The transformation is a modular arithmetic operation, but the offset varies depending on the input color.  We need more data points to develop a rule that maps input colors to offset values. The spatial arrangement is preserved.


**Overall Observations after Four Examples:**

The transformation consistently preserves spatial arrangement.  The transformation is a color mapping based on a modular arithmetic operation, `(input_value + offset) % 10`, but the offset is not consistently determined by the evenness/oddness of the input value.  More data points are needed to identify the rule governing the offset.  This will likely involve observing the input color and the corresponding output color to build a look-up table or define a function.


I'm ready for the test phase, but a more robust set of examples would make the task easier.  More examples would help to refine the hypothesis.
