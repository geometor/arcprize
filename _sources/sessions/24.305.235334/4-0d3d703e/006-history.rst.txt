**Example 1 Analysis**

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   3: 3
    *   1: 3
    *   2: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangular blocks of green, blue and red.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   4: 3
    *   5: 3
    *   6: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangular blocks of yellow, gray, and magenta.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: Each color in the input is replaced with a color of a higher value.  The mapping appears to be a simple increment of 1 to each value (3 -> 4, 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3). However, this increment is not the actual color change, it is instead a shift in the values, which results in a different color.  The color mapping needs to be considered.  Using the `COLOR_MAP` provided, the transformation is: green (3) -> yellow (4), blue (1) -> gray (5), red (2) -> magenta (6).

**Transformation:**

*   The transformation appears to be a direct mapping of input colors to output colors based on an offset of +1 to each input color value, where the offset is taken relative to the color value.

**Hypothesis:**

The transformation involves a simple arithmetic operation on the input grid's cell values to produce the output grid values.  Specifically, the values seem to be incremented by 1. This increment is performed in the numerical representation of the color and then translated to the output color using the color mapping.  This maintains the spatial layout of the input grid.

To test this, we'll need additional examples.  Further examples would help to confirm or refute the transformation and possibly provide additional detail about the mapping of colors.

**Example 2 Analysis**

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   2: 3
    *   3: 3
    *   8: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangular blocks of red, green, and azure.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   6: 3
    *   4: 3
    *   9: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangular blocks of magenta, yellow, and maroon.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed:  Similar to Example 1, each color is replaced with a different color.  The transformation is not a simple numerical increment.  The mapping is: red (2) -> magenta (6), green (3) -> yellow (4), azure (8) -> maroon (9).

**Transformation:**

The transformation is not simply adding 1, but rather a more complex mapping. Let's analyze the numerical differences between input and output colors:

*   2 (red) -> 6 (magenta): +4
*   3 (green) -> 4 (yellow): +1
*   8 (azure) -> 9 (maroon): +1

There's no immediately obvious pattern from these numerical differences.  However, if we inspect the color indices, we find there is a pattern:

- Input color index + 4 mod 10 for color 2 and color 8.
- Input color index + 1 mod 10 for color 3.

This suggest the transformation may not be a simple arithmetic operation on the pixel values but rather a modular arithmetic operation considering the total number of possible colors (10).  This will need further verification with more examples.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

The transformation involves a modular arithmetic operation (+1 mod 10 or +4 mod 10) on the input grid's color values to produce the output grid values, depending on the initial color.  The choice of offset (1 or 4) may depend on some property of the input color, but not immediately apparent from the provided examples. The spatial layout of the input grid is maintained.  More examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis and identify the conditions that determine the modular offset.


**Overall Observations after Two Examples:**

The transformation preserves the spatial arrangement of colors. The transformation involves changing each color to another color based on a complex mapping rather than a simple arithmetic operation on the pixel values.  The mapping seems to involve modular arithmetic, but the rules for determining the modular offset need further investigation with more examples.

**Example 3 Analysis**

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   5: 3
    *   8: 3
    *   6: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangular blocks of gray, azure, and magenta.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   1: 3
    *   9: 3
    *   2: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangular blocks of blue, maroon, and red.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: Gray (5) -> blue (1), azure (8) -> maroon (9), magenta (6) -> red (2).

**Transformation:**

Let's analyze the numerical differences and modulo operation:

*   5 (gray) -> 1 (blue): -4  (or +6 mod 10)
*   8 (azure) -> 9 (maroon): +1 (or +1 mod 10)
*   6 (magenta) -> 2 (red): -4 (or +6 mod 10)

This example adds further evidence to the hypothesis of a modular arithmetic transformation.  Colors with an even input value seem to undergo a +6 mod 10 transformation, while colors with an odd input value seem to undergo a +1 mod 10 transformation.

**Revised Hypothesis (incorporating Example 3):**

The transformation involves a modular arithmetic operation (+1 mod 10 or +6 mod 10) on the input grid's color values. The offset is determined by whether the input color value is even or odd.

*   If the input color value is even, add +6 mod 10.
*   If the input color value is odd, add +1 mod 10.

The spatial layout of the input grid is preserved.  This hypothesis needs further testing with more examples but seems strongly supported by the three examples provided so far.


**Overall Observations after Three Examples:**

The transformation consistently preserves the spatial arrangement of colors. The core transformation appears to be modular arithmetic, specifically:

*   Odd input color values: `(value + 1) % 10`
*   Even input color values: `(value + 6) % 10`

This rule needs to be tested against further examples before being considered definitive.  The lack of a clear visual or spatial pattern between the input and output necessitates a color-based transformation rule.

I am ready for the test phase.

**Example 4 Analysis**

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   9: 3
    *   4: 3
    *   2: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangular blocks of maroon, yellow, and red.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   8: 3
    *   3: 3
    *   6: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangular blocks of azure, green, and magenta.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: Maroon (9) -> azure (8), yellow (4) -> green (3), red (2) -> magenta (6).

**Transformation:**

Let's analyze the numerical differences and modulo operation:

*   9 (maroon) -> 8 (azure): -1 (or +9 mod 10)
*   4 (yellow) -> 3 (green): -1 (or +9 mod 10)
*   2 (red) -> 6 (magenta): +4 (or +4 mod 10)


This example introduces a new complexity. The previous hypothesis doesn't fully explain this transformation. There's no consistent even/odd rule here. It appears that the transformation is still modular arithmetic, but the offset seems dependent on the specific input color.  


**Revised Hypothesis (incorporating Example 4):**

The transformation is a modular arithmetic operation, but the offset varies depending on the input color.  We need more data points to develop a rule that maps input colors to offset values. The spatial arrangement is preserved.


**Overall Observations after Four Examples:**

The transformation consistently preserves spatial arrangement.  The transformation is a color mapping based on a modular arithmetic operation, `(input_value + offset) % 10`, but the offset is not consistently determined by the evenness/oddness of the input value.  More data points are needed to identify the rule governing the offset.  This will likely involve observing the input color and the corresponding output color to build a look-up table or define a function.


I'm ready for the test phase, but a more robust set of examples would make the task easier.  More examples would help to refine the hypothesis.

**examples summary**

The transformation applied to the input grids to generate the output grids in examples 1-4 shows a consistent pattern:  the spatial arrangement of colors remains unchanged;  the transformation is a color mapping achieved through a modular arithmetic operation. However, the offset used in this modular arithmetic operation appears to depend on the specific input color.

Let's summarize the observed transformations:

| Input Color (Value) | Input Color Name | Output Color (Value) | Output Color Name | Offset |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | Green | 4 | Yellow | +1 |
| 1 | Blue | 5 | Gray | +4 |
| 2 | Red | 3 | Green | +1 |
| 8 | Azure | 9 | Maroon | +1 |
| 5 | Gray | 1 | Blue | -4 (+6 mod 10) |
| 6 | Magenta | 2 | Red | -4 (+6 mod 10) |
| 9 | Maroon | 8 | Azure | -1 (+9 mod 10) |
| 4 | Yellow | 3 | Green | -1 (+9 mod 10) |
| 2 | Red | 6 | Magenta | +4 |


The table highlights the inconsistency.  While a modular arithmetic operation is involved, a single, simple rule isn't evident.  The offset seems to depend on the specific input color value.


To investigate further, let's analyze the data using Python.  We'll create a dictionary mapping input colors to their offsets:

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    input_output_mapping = {
        3: 1,
        1: 4,
        2: 1,
        8: 1,
        5: 6,
        6: 6,
        9: 9,
        4: 9,
        2: 4
    }
    
    print(input_output_mapping)

code_execution_result: 1

```
{3: 1, 1: 4, 2: 4, 8: 1, 5: 6, 6: 6, 9: 9, 4: 9}

```

The corrected `input_output_mapping` dictionary reveals that there's no readily apparent mathematical pattern determining the offset. There are two distinct mappings: one where a +1 offset is used and another where a +4 offset is used. The dataset is insufficient to conclude on the specific rule.  More examples are needed to determine the offset-assignment rule.  A larger dataset may reveal a pattern or require a machine learning model to predict the offset based on the input color.  Currently, the best approach is to treat the offset as a lookup table based on the input color.
