The transformation applied to the input grids to generate the output grids in examples 1-4 shows a consistent pattern:  the spatial arrangement of colors remains unchanged;  the transformation is a color mapping achieved through a modular arithmetic operation. However, the offset used in this modular arithmetic operation appears to depend on the specific input color.

Let's summarize the observed transformations:

| Input Color (Value) | Input Color Name | Output Color (Value) | Output Color Name | Offset |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | Green | 4 | Yellow | +1 |
| 1 | Blue | 5 | Gray | +4 |
| 2 | Red | 3 | Green | +1 |
| 8 | Azure | 9 | Maroon | +1 |
| 5 | Gray | 1 | Blue | -4 (+6 mod 10) |
| 6 | Magenta | 2 | Red | -4 (+6 mod 10) |
| 9 | Maroon | 8 | Azure | -1 (+9 mod 10) |
| 4 | Yellow | 3 | Green | -1 (+9 mod 10) |
| 2 | Red | 6 | Magenta | +4 |


The table highlights the inconsistency.  While a modular arithmetic operation is involved, a single, simple rule isn't evident.  The offset seems to depend on the specific input color value.


To investigate further, let's analyze the data using Python.  We'll create a dictionary mapping input colors to their offsets:

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    input_output_mapping = {
        3: 1,
        1: 4,
        2: 1,
        8: 1,
        5: 6,
        6: 6,
        9: 9,
        4: 9,
        2: 4
    }
    
    print(input_output_mapping)

code_execution_result: 1

```
{3: 1, 1: 4, 2: 4, 8: 1, 5: 6, 6: 6, 9: 9, 4: 9}

```

The corrected `input_output_mapping` dictionary reveals that there's no readily apparent mathematical pattern determining the offset. There are two distinct mappings: one where a +1 offset is used and another where a +4 offset is used. The dataset is insufficient to conclude on the specific rule.  More examples are needed to determine the offset-assignment rule.  A larger dataset may reveal a pattern or require a machine learning model to predict the offset based on the input color.  Currently, the best approach is to treat the offset as a lookup table based on the input color.
