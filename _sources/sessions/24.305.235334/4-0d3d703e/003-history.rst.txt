**Example 1 Analysis**

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   3: 3
    *   1: 3
    *   2: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangular blocks of green, blue and red.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   4: 3
    *   5: 3
    *   6: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangular blocks of yellow, gray, and magenta.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: Each color in the input is replaced with a color of a higher value.  The mapping appears to be a simple increment of 1 to each value (3 -> 4, 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3). However, this increment is not the actual color change, it is instead a shift in the values, which results in a different color.  The color mapping needs to be considered.  Using the `COLOR_MAP` provided, the transformation is: green (3) -> yellow (4), blue (1) -> gray (5), red (2) -> magenta (6).

**Transformation:**

*   The transformation appears to be a direct mapping of input colors to output colors based on an offset of +1 to each input color value, where the offset is taken relative to the color value.

**Hypothesis:**

The transformation involves a simple arithmetic operation on the input grid's cell values to produce the output grid values.  Specifically, the values seem to be incremented by 1. This increment is performed in the numerical representation of the color and then translated to the output color using the color mapping.  This maintains the spatial layout of the input grid.

To test this, we'll need additional examples.  Further examples would help to confirm or refute the transformation and possibly provide additional detail about the mapping of colors.

**Example 2 Analysis**

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   2: 3
    *   3: 3
    *   8: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangular blocks of red, green, and azure.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   6: 3
    *   4: 3
    *   9: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangular blocks of magenta, yellow, and maroon.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed:  Similar to Example 1, each color is replaced with a different color.  The transformation is not a simple numerical increment.  The mapping is: red (2) -> magenta (6), green (3) -> yellow (4), azure (8) -> maroon (9).

**Transformation:**

The transformation is not simply adding 1, but rather a more complex mapping. Let's analyze the numerical differences between input and output colors:

*   2 (red) -> 6 (magenta): +4
*   3 (green) -> 4 (yellow): +1
*   8 (azure) -> 9 (maroon): +1

There's no immediately obvious pattern from these numerical differences.  However, if we inspect the color indices, we find there is a pattern:

- Input color index + 4 mod 10 for color 2 and color 8.
- Input color index + 1 mod 10 for color 3.

This suggest the transformation may not be a simple arithmetic operation on the pixel values but rather a modular arithmetic operation considering the total number of possible colors (10).  This will need further verification with more examples.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

The transformation involves a modular arithmetic operation (+1 mod 10 or +4 mod 10) on the input grid's color values to produce the output grid values, depending on the initial color.  The choice of offset (1 or 4) may depend on some property of the input color, but not immediately apparent from the provided examples. The spatial layout of the input grid is maintained.  More examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis and identify the conditions that determine the modular offset.


**Overall Observations after Two Examples:**

The transformation preserves the spatial arrangement of colors. The transformation involves changing each color to another color based on a complex mapping rather than a simple arithmetic operation on the pixel values.  The mapping seems to involve modular arithmetic, but the rules for determining the modular offset need further investigation with more examples.
