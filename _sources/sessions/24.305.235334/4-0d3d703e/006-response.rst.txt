**Test Input Analysis**

The test input grid has the following properties:

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   8: 3
    *   1: 3
    *   3: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangular blocks of azure, blue, and green.

Based on the analysis of the previous examples, we expect the transformation to involve a modular arithmetic operation, `(input_value + offset) % 10`, where the offset depends on the input color.  The spatial arrangement of the colors will remain the same.  We will use the `input_output_mapping` dictionary derived from the example analysis to predict the output colors:

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    input_output_mapping = {
        3: 1,
        1: 4,
        2: 4,
        8: 1,
        5: 6,
        6: 6,
        9: 9,
        4: 9
    }
    
    input_grid = [[8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3]]
    output_grid = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
    
    for row in range(len(input_grid)):
      for col in range(len(input_grid[row])):
        input_color = input_grid[row][col]
        offset = input_output_mapping.get(input_color, 0) # Handle cases where input color is not in the mapping
        output_color = (input_color + offset) % 10
        output_grid[row][col] = output_color
    
    print(output_grid)

code_execution_result: 1

```
[[9, 5, 4], [9, 5, 4], [9, 5, 4]]

```

**Predicted Output:**

Based on the `input_output_mapping` and the modular arithmetic operation, the predicted output grid is:

```
[[9, 5, 4],
 [9, 5, 4],
 [9, 5, 4]]
```

This corresponds to three 1x3 blocks of maroon, gray, and yellow.

**Justification:**

*   8 (azure) + 1 (offset from mapping) % 10 = 9 (maroon)
*   1 (blue) + 4 (offset from mapping) % 10 = 5 (gray)
*   3 (green) + 1 (offset from mapping) % 10 = 4 (yellow)


The transformation preserves the spatial arrangement and applies a color mapping based on the previously determined modular arithmetic rule and the lookup table.  The accuracy of this prediction depends entirely on the completeness and accuracy of the `input_output_mapping` dictionary, which is based on the limited examples provided.  A more extensive set of training examples would increase the confidence in the prediction accuracy.
