The working output grid has been initialized to a 3x3 grid filled with 0s (white). This is appropriate as a starting point, since the output grid's dimensions are the same as the input grid's and the output grid does not appear to directly inherit the input grid's color arrangement.

Next steps will involve iterating through the input grid and setting pixels in the output grid based on the predicted output colors determined using the `input_output_mapping`.

The working output grid now matches the predicted output grid.  All pixels have been set according to the transformation rule derived from the examples.

Submitting the solution...


The solution was submitted.  The accuracy of the solution depends heavily on the correctness of the  `input_output_mapping` derived from the limited examples provided.  More examples would strengthen the model's predictive capability and improve the confidence in the solution's accuracy.
