**observations**

Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**example_1**

**input:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 6
objects:
  - A cluster of 'azure' (8) pixels forming an irregular shape.
```

**output:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 42
  - 8: 6
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - Same 'azure' (8) cluster as the input.
  - Two additional 'blue' (1) pixels appear, one above and to the right of the cluster and one below and to the left of the cluster.
```

**differences:**
```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed: Two 'azure' (8) pixels are changed to 'blue' (1) pixels.  The new blue pixels appear to be adjacent to the existing azure cluster.
```

**transformation:**
```
- The transformation appears to add two 'blue' (1) pixels in specific positions relative to the existing cluster of 'azure' (8) pixels.  The positions suggest a diagonal offset from the cluster's edges.  More examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis.
```

To further understand the rule, I need more examples to confirm the observed pattern and consider edge cases (what happens if the cluster touches the edge of the grid?).

**observations**

**example_2**

**input:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 41
  - 8: 9
objects:
  - A cluster of 'azure' (8) pixels forming an irregular, somewhat L-shaped form.
```

**output:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 40
  - 8: 9
  - 1: 3
objects:
  - Same 'azure' (8) cluster as input.
  - Three additional 'blue' (1) pixels appear, one adjacent to each of three edges of the cluster.  The positions are similar to example 1, offset diagonally from the cluster edges.
```

**differences:**
```
cells_changed: 3
colors_changed: Three 'azure' (8) pixels changed to 'blue' (1) pixels. The new blue pixels are adjacent to the azure cluster.
```

**transformation:**
```
- The transformation adds 'blue' (1) pixels adjacent to the 'azure' (8) cluster. The placement of the new blue pixels is consistent across both examples and suggests a rule relating to the location of existing cluster edges.  To refine this, we need to investigate what happens when the cluster is larger or differently shaped and when the cluster is against the boundary of the grid.  This requires more examples.
```

**Ruminate Phase:**

Based on the two examples, the transformation rule appears to be:

1. **Identify Azure Clusters:** Find all connected regions of azure (8) pixels.

2. **Add Blue Pixels:** For each azure cluster, add a blue (1) pixel adjacent to each edge of the cluster.  The addition appears to create a slight offset from each direct edge. It might be a diagonal offset of one pixel from each edge.

**Hypotheses to Test:**

* **Cluster Size:** Does the size of the azure cluster influence the number of blue pixels added? (expect a linear relationship, one blue pixel per edge)

* **Cluster Shape:** Does the shape of the azure cluster impact the placement of the blue pixels? (expect placement to be consistent)

* **Edge Cases:** What happens when the azure cluster is touching or extends to the boundary of the grid? (This is important to refine rule)


More examples are crucial to validate the rule and handle edge cases.  The current hypothesis needs further testing.

**examples summary**

- summarize your observations to explain the transformation of the input to output

- use code_execution to investigate properties, patterns and differences in the grids
