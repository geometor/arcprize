**example_2**

**input:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 41
  - 8: 9
objects:
  - A cluster of 'azure' (8) pixels forming an irregular, somewhat L-shaped form.
```

**output:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 40
  - 8: 9
  - 1: 3
objects:
  - Same 'azure' (8) cluster as input.
  - Three additional 'blue' (1) pixels appear, one adjacent to each of three edges of the cluster.  The positions are similar to example 1, offset diagonally from the cluster edges.
```

**differences:**
```
cells_changed: 3
colors_changed: Three 'azure' (8) pixels changed to 'blue' (1) pixels. The new blue pixels are adjacent to the azure cluster.
```

**transformation:**
```
- The transformation adds 'blue' (1) pixels adjacent to the 'azure' (8) cluster. The placement of the new blue pixels is consistent across both examples and suggests a rule relating to the location of existing cluster edges.  To refine this, we need to investigate what happens when the cluster is larger or differently shaped and when the cluster is against the boundary of the grid.  This requires more examples.
```

**Ruminate Phase:**

Based on the two examples, the transformation rule appears to be:

1. **Identify Azure Clusters:** Find all connected regions of azure (8) pixels.

2. **Add Blue Pixels:** For each azure cluster, add a blue (1) pixel adjacent to each edge of the cluster.  The addition appears to create a slight offset from each direct edge. It might be a diagonal offset of one pixel from each edge.

**Hypotheses to Test:**

* **Cluster Size:** Does the size of the azure cluster influence the number of blue pixels added? (expect a linear relationship, one blue pixel per edge)

* **Cluster Shape:** Does the shape of the azure cluster impact the placement of the blue pixels? (expect placement to be consistent)

* **Edge Cases:** What happens when the azure cluster is touching or extends to the boundary of the grid? (This is important to refine rule)


More examples are crucial to validate the rule and handle edge cases.  The current hypothesis needs further testing.
