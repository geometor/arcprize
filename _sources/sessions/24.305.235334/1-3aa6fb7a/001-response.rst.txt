Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**example_1**

**input:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 6
objects:
  - A cluster of 'azure' (8) pixels forming an irregular shape.
```

**output:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 42
  - 8: 6
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - Same 'azure' (8) cluster as the input.
  - Two additional 'blue' (1) pixels appear, one above and to the right of the cluster and one below and to the left of the cluster.
```

**differences:**
```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed: Two 'azure' (8) pixels are changed to 'blue' (1) pixels.  The new blue pixels appear to be adjacent to the existing azure cluster.
```

**transformation:**
```
- The transformation appears to add two 'blue' (1) pixels in specific positions relative to the existing cluster of 'azure' (8) pixels.  The positions suggest a diagonal offset from the cluster's edges.  More examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis.
```

To further understand the rule, I need more examples to confirm the observed pattern and consider edge cases (what happens if the cluster touches the edge of the grid?).
