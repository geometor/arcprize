**Example 3 Observations:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (73)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   6: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (2, 2)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (7, 3)
    *   A single magenta (6) pixel at (5, 6)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (64)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   6: (1)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (2, 2)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (7, 3)
    *   A single magenta (6) pixel at (5, 6)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels forming a cross around the red pixel.
    *   Four orange (7) pixels forming a cross around the blue pixel.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around the red (2) and blue (1) pixels, respectively.


**Transformation:**

The transformation in this example is consistent with the previous examples.  A cross pattern of yellow (4) is added around red (2) pixels, and a cross pattern of orange (7) is added around blue (1) pixels. The magenta (6) pixel remains unchanged.  There's no apparent transformation rule for magenta (6)


**Overall Pattern Summary (Across All Examples):**

The core transformation rule seems to be:

1.  **Identify pixels of color 1 (blue) and 2 (red).**
2.  **Add a cross pattern of color 4 (yellow) around each pixel of color 2 (red).**
3.  **Add a cross pattern of color 7 (orange) around each pixel of color 1 (blue).**

Other colors remain unchanged.  The size of the cross pattern is consistently 2x2.

This observation supports the earlier hypothesis and provides a clearer, more concise description of the transformation.  There is no clear rule for other colours (besides 0, which represents background), and further examples would be required to determine if any such rules exist.
