## observations:

Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (73)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (64)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels forming a cross around the red pixel at (2,2), (2,4), (4,2), (4,4).
    *   Four orange (7) pixels forming a cross around the blue pixel at (5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6).


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels; forming crosses around the initial red and blue pixels respectively.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve identifying single pixels of colors 1 and 2. Then, surrounding these pixels with a cross pattern of pixels of colors 4 and 7, respectively. The cross pattern is of size 2x2, centered on the original color.
