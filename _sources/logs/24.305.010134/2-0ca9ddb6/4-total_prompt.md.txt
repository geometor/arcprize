## observations:

Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (73)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (64)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels forming a cross around the red pixel at (2,2), (2,4), (4,2), (4,4).
    *   Four orange (7) pixels forming a cross around the blue pixel at (5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6).


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels; forming crosses around the initial red and blue pixels respectively.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve identifying single pixels of colors 1 and 2. Then, surrounding these pixels with a cross pattern of pixels of colors 4 and 7, respectively. The cross pattern is of size 2x2, centered on the original color.

**Example 2**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (68)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single azure (8) pixel at (3, 0)
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3, 2) and (6, 6)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (6, 2) and (7, 0)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (56)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   4: (6)
    *   7: (8)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single azure (8) pixel at (3, 0)
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3, 2) and (6, 6)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (6, 2) and (7, 0)
    *   Six yellow (4) pixels surrounding the red pixels
    *   Eight orange (7) pixels surrounding the blue pixels

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 14
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around the blue and red pixels, respectively.  The pattern is similar to example 1, a cross pattern for blue, but seems to use a box shape for red.

**Transformation:**

The transformation is similar to Example 1, but with variations:

*   Single instances of blue (1) are surrounded by a 2x2 cross of orange (7).
*   Single instances of red (2) are surrounded by a 2x2 box of yellow (4).  This differs from Example 1, which used a cross.

The transformation seems to depend on the original color of the pixel (1 or 2) and  the location of the pixel. The surrounding pattern is consistent based on the color but not always on the shape.



**Summary of Transformations:**

Both examples show a pattern of adding pixels around certain colors.  The pattern is dependent on the target color:

*   Blue (1):  a cross pattern of orange (7) is added.
*   Red (2): The pattern of yellow (4) is added, this could be a cross pattern or a box pattern.  This requires further investigation.


The next step is to test this hypothesis on a new input grid.

## observations:

**Example 3 Observations:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (73)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   6: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (2, 2)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (7, 3)
    *   A single magenta (6) pixel at (5, 6)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (64)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   6: (1)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (2, 2)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (7, 3)
    *   A single magenta (6) pixel at (5, 6)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels forming a cross around the red pixel.
    *   Four orange (7) pixels forming a cross around the blue pixel.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around the red (2) and blue (1) pixels, respectively.


**Transformation:**

The transformation in this example is consistent with the previous examples.  A cross pattern of yellow (4) is added around red (2) pixels, and a cross pattern of orange (7) is added around blue (1) pixels. The magenta (6) pixel remains unchanged.  There's no apparent transformation rule for magenta (6)


**Overall Pattern Summary (Across All Examples):**

The core transformation rule seems to be:

1.  **Identify pixels of color 1 (blue) and 2 (red).**
2.  **Add a cross pattern of color 4 (yellow) around each pixel of color 2 (red).**
3.  **Add a cross pattern of color 7 (orange) around each pixel of color 1 (blue).**

Other colors remain unchanged.  The size of the cross pattern is consistently 2x2.

This observation supports the earlier hypothesis and provides a clearer, more concise description of the transformation.  There is no clear rule for other colours (besides 0, which represents background), and further examples would be required to determine if any such rules exist.
