The examples show significant differences between input and output grids.  Therefore, `initialize_output_from_input` is not appropriate.

Instead, I will use `initialize_output_by_size` to create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (0).

code_execution:
```python
print(default_api.initialize_output_by_size(height=9, width=9, color=0))
```
