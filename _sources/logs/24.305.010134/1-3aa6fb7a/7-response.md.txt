Here's a plan to update the working grid and submit the solution. Because the transformation rule isn't fully defined, we'll proceed iteratively, adding blue pixels based on the previously identified potential locations and refining our approach based on any feedback.  The selection of pixels to change (`blue_pixel_indices`) is still a crucial aspect that requires further refinement based on more examples.

working_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                     [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                     [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

Setting pixel at row=0, col=4 to blue (1)
Setting pixel at row=1, col=5 to blue (1)
Setting pixel at row=1, col=2 to blue (1)
Setting pixel at row=2, col=1 to blue (1)
Setting pixel at row=0, col=1 to blue (1)
Setting pixel at row=3, col=4 to blue (1)
Setting pixel at row=3, col=2 to blue (1)
Setting pixel at row=2, col=3 to blue (1)
Setting pixel at row=4, col=5 to blue (1)
Setting pixel at row=5, col=4 to blue (1)
Setting pixel at row=4, col=1 to blue (1)
Updated working grid:
[[0 1 0 0 1 8 8]
 [8 8 1 0 0 1 8]
 [8 1 0 1 0 0 0]
 [0 0 1 8 1 0 0]
 [0 1 0 8 8 1 0]
 [0 8 0 0 1 0 0]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

The submission was unsuccessful.  This highlights the need for a more precise understanding of the rule governing the addition of blue pixels.  The current approach, while based on observed patterns, is insufficient to solve the puzzle accurately.  More examples are needed.  Also, systematic exploration of all adjacent locations may be necessary to find the correct pattern.  A more sophisticated algorithm might be required, such as a machine learning model or a rule-discovery algorithm, trained on a larger set of examples to identify the rule governing the transformation.  In short, more examples and a more robust algorithm for determining the underlying rule are necessary to consistently solve similar puzzles.
