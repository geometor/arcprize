The analysis of the provided examples and the test case has revealed that a simple rule-based approach is insufficient to solve this puzzle accurately.  The unsuccessful submissions highlight the limitations of relying on visual inspection and hand-picked pixel selections. The core issue lies in the lack of a precisely defined rule governing the addition of blue pixels.

To successfully solve this type of puzzle, a more robust and data-driven strategy is required. This involves:

1. **Gathering More Data:**  The most critical step is to acquire a much larger dataset of input-output pairs. This expanded dataset will allow for more robust pattern recognition and training of a predictive model.

2. **Enhancing Feature Engineering:** Features beyond simple adjacency must be incorporated.  These could include:
    - Cluster size (number of connected azure pixels).
    - Cluster shape (e.g., circularity, aspect ratio).
    - Proximity to other clusters.
    - Perimeter length (number of azure pixels adjacent to white pixels).
    - Cluster centroid coordinates.
    - Moments of inertia and other spatial moments that describe the shape of the cluster.

3. **Machine Learning Model Development:**  A suitable machine learning model (e.g., a classification or regression model) can be trained on the enriched features to predict the locations of the added blue pixels. This approach offers greater generalizability and accuracy compared to manual rule-based methods.

4. **Utilizing Rule-Discovery Algorithms:**  Rule-discovery algorithms can automate the process of extracting the transformation rules from the data, potentially eliminating the need for manual feature engineering and model selection.  These algorithms can identify complex relationships that may not be immediately apparent through visual inspection.

The current approach, relying on a small number of examples and manual pixel selection, is fundamentally flawed for solving this type of puzzle.  The unsuccessful submissions clearly demonstrate this limitation. To achieve consistent accuracy, a transition to data-driven machine learning methods with a significantly larger dataset is essential.  Without additional examples and the implementation of these advanced techniques, a reliable solution cannot be guaranteed.  The working grid remains unchanged, as the current approach has proven inadequate.
