The working output grid has been initialized as a copy of the input grid. This is a good starting point given the nature of the transformation observed in the examples. The next step is to iteratively add blue pixels according to the hypothesized rule (adding blue pixels adjacent to azure pixels, but not to all adjacent pixels).  More examples are needed to refine the selection process of which pixels to change.
