Here's how to initialize the working output grid. Given that the examples show relatively few differences between input and output (only a few pixels change color), `initialize_output_from_input` is the more appropriate choice.  It will create a copy of the input grid, providing a starting point that's close to the desired output. This will likely lead to fewer steps and a simpler solution process compared to starting from scratch using `initialize_output_by_size`.

function_call:

initialize_output_from_input


result:
