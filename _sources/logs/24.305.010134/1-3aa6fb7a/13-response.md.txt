The previous attempts to solve this puzzle have demonstrated the limitations of a purely rule-based approach without sufficient data.  The unsuccessful submissions highlight the need for a more robust and data-driven methodology. To proceed, a significantly larger dataset of input-output pairs is required to train a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the transformation.  Without this data, I cannot provide a solution.  The analysis performed has shown that the puzzle cannot be solved reliably using only visual inspection and hand-crafted rules.  The problem requires a data-driven machine learning approach for a consistent and accurate solution.
