The transformation rule appears to involve adding blue (1) pixels adjacent to existing azure (8) pixels.  However, the rule is not simply adding a blue pixel to *every* adjacent white (0) cell.  Instead, a subset of adjacent white cells is selected to receive a blue pixel.

The number of blue pixels added seems to be related to the size or shape of the azure cluster, though the exact relationship requires more data points to establish.


Let's analyze the spatial distribution of the added blue pixels to see if we can identify any patterns:

import numpy as np

example1_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],

                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

example2_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],

                         [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

example2_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

def find_added_pixels(input_array, output_array):
  diff = output_array - input_array
  return np.where(diff == 1)

example1_added = find_added_pixels(example1_input, example1_output)
example2_added = find_added_pixels(example2_input, example2_output)

print("Example 1 added pixels:", example1_added)
print("Example 2 added pixels:", example2_added)

```

code_execution_result: 1

```
Example 1 added pixels: (array([1, 4]), array([2, 4]))
Example 2 added pixels: (array([1, 2, 5]), array([4, 3, 3]))

```

The coordinates of the added blue pixels don't immediately reveal a clear geometric pattern.  More examples are needed to determine if there's a consistent rule governing the selection of these locations.  The current hypothesis is that the selection is based on adjacency to the azure cluster, but some further refinement of the selection criteria is needed.  The number of added blue pixels may also be related to the size or perimeter of the azure cluster.  Further investigation will focus on these possibilities.
