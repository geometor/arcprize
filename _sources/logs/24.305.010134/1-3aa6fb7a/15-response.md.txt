The provided examples and the test case highlight a key limitation:  the absence of a clearly defined rule governing the placement of the blue pixels.  My previous attempts, based on visual inspection and hand-picked selections, have consistently failed to produce the correct solution.  This underscores the need for a more data-driven approach.  Without additional examples, I cannot reliably determine the underlying pattern and therefore cannot accurately complete the puzzle.  The current approach is insufficient; a machine learning model trained on a substantially larger dataset is required for a consistent solution.
