Based on the analysis and the unsuccessful submission, it's clear that a more sophisticated approach is needed to solve this puzzle. The current method relies on a hand-picked subset of potential blue pixel locations and lacks the robustness to handle variations in the input patterns.  To improve accuracy and generalize the solution, a more data-driven method is necessary.

The key challenge is to accurately determine the selection criteria for adding blue pixels.  Visual inspection and intuitive reasoning have proven insufficient. Therefore, the next steps should focus on:

1. **Acquiring more examples:** A larger dataset of input-output pairs is essential for effective pattern recognition and the development of a robust model.

2. **Feature engineering:** More descriptive features beyond simple adjacency need to be considered. These might include cluster size, shape, perimeter, and proximity to other clusters.

3. **Developing a machine learning model:** A model trained on these richer features could predict the locations of the new blue pixels more accurately.

4. **Implementing a rule-discovery algorithm:** This would automate the process of finding the underlying rules from the examples.

The current code and approach should be abandoned in favor of a more advanced and data-driven strategy.  Without more data (additional examples),  a successful solution cannot be guaranteed. The current attempt provided an intermediate solution based on an incomplete and possibly inaccurate understanding of the underlying transformation rule.
