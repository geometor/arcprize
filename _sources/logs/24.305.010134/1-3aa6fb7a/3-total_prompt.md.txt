## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**input:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 43
    - 8: 6
  objects:
    - A cluster of 6 'azure' (8) pixels forming an irregular shape.

**output:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 42
    - 8: 6
    - 1: 2
  objects:
    - Same 'azure' (8) cluster as input.
    - Two new 'blue' (1) pixels appear, one above and to the right of the azure cluster, and one below and to the right.

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 2
  colors_changed: Two 'azure' pixels changed to 'blue'.

**transformation:**
  - The transformation appears to add two 'blue' pixels.  The positions of the new 'blue' pixels are relative to the existing cluster of 'azure' pixels.  Specifically, they appear to be  adjacent to the bottom-right and top-right 'azure' pixels. This suggests a rule involving adjacency and cluster expansion, however more examples are needed to fully confirm this.  Further observation is needed to fully define the rule.

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, following the same format as example_1:

**input:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 43
    - 8: 8
  objects:
    - A cluster of 8 'azure' (8) pixels forming an irregular 'L' shape.

**output:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 40
    - 8: 8
    - 1: 3
  objects:
    - Same 'azure' (8) cluster as input.
    - Three new 'blue' (1) pixels appear, one adjacent to each of three of the azure pixels.  These three azure pixels are not all adjacent to each other.


**differences:**
  cells_changed: 3
  colors_changed: Three 'azure' pixels changed to 'blue'.

**transformation:**
  - This example further supports the hypothesis of adding 'blue' pixels adjacent to 'azure' pixels.  However, it also shows that not *all* adjacent 'azure' pixels get changed. It seems to be a subset of adjacent pixels based on an unknown rule.  More examples would clarify the selection rule for which adjacent pixels become blue.  The rule is not simply adding blue pixels to every adjacent white space.


**Comparison of Example 1 and 2:**

Both examples show the addition of blue pixels adjacent to existing azure clusters. The number of blue pixels added appears to be related to the size of the azure cluster, though not in a simple one-to-one relationship.  The placement of the new blue pixels isn't strictly uniform - it selects a subset of possible adjacent locations.  Additional examples are crucial to determine the precise selection criteria for adding blue pixels.  Is there a spatial pattern to the addition? Is there a maximum number of blue pixels added per cluster? Is there a bias towards the top or bottom, left or right for adding the blue pixels?

To confidently determine the transformation rules, more examples are necessary to reveal any underlying patterns.  Further analysis should focus on the following:
- The relationship between cluster size and the number of blue pixels added.
- The spatial pattern or criteria used to select the locations for the new blue pixels.
- The possibility of additional rules or factors influencing the transformation.
