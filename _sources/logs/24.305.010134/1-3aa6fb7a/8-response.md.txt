The submission was unsuccessful, indicating that the current hypothesis regarding the transformation rule needs refinement.  The selection of `blue_pixel_indices` was based on a visual inspection and educated guess, which proved insufficient.  A more systematic and data-driven approach is required.

To improve the accuracy of the solution, a more robust method for identifying the location of the new blue pixels is needed. This requires further analysis of the provided examples and possibly the incorporation of machine learning techniques.  The current reliance on a hand-picked subset of potential locations is prone to errors and lacks the generalization capability needed to handle variations in the input.

**Further Steps:**

1. **More Examples:** The most crucial step is to obtain additional examples of input-output pairs.  A larger dataset will allow for more robust pattern recognition and the development of a more accurate predictive model.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Instead of relying solely on adjacency, additional features could be engineered to capture more nuanced aspects of the transformation. These might include:
    * Cluster size: The number of connected azure pixels in each cluster.
    * Cluster shape:  A descriptor quantifying the shape of each cluster (e.g., circularity, aspect ratio).
    * Proximity to other clusters: The distance between clusters.
    * Perimeter length of the cluster: The number of azure pixels which have an adjacent white pixel.

3. **Machine Learning Model:** A machine learning model (such as a classification or regression model) could be trained on the features identified in step 2 to predict the location of the new blue pixels.  This would provide a more data-driven and generalizable approach to the problem.

4. **Rule-Discovery Algorithm:**  A rule-discovery algorithm could be employed to automatically extract the underlying transformation rules from the examples. This would eliminate the need for manual feature engineering and model selection.

5. **Systematic Exploration:**  Instead of selecting blue pixel locations arbitrarily, a systematic approach that explores all potential locations around each azure pixel could be implemented. This ensures that no potential locations are missed.  A scoring system could be devised to prioritize potential locations based on factors identified above.

The current approach is essentially a brute force attempt with an incomplete understanding of the transformation rules.  Employing more advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques will likely be necessary to solve this type of puzzle consistently.
