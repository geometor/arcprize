Here's an analysis of example_1:

**input:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 43
    - 8: 6
  objects:
    - A cluster of 6 'azure' (8) pixels forming an irregular shape.

**output:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 42
    - 8: 6
    - 1: 2
  objects:
    - Same 'azure' (8) cluster as input.
    - Two new 'blue' (1) pixels appear, one above and to the right of the azure cluster, and one below and to the right.

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 2
  colors_changed: Two 'azure' pixels changed to 'blue'.

**transformation:**
  - The transformation appears to add two 'blue' pixels.  The positions of the new 'blue' pixels are relative to the existing cluster of 'azure' pixels.  Specifically, they appear to be  adjacent to the bottom-right and top-right 'azure' pixels. This suggests a rule involving adjacency and cluster expansion, however more examples are needed to fully confirm this.  Further observation is needed to fully define the rule.
