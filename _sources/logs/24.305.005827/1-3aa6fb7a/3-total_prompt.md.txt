## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (41)
    *   8: (5)
*   objects: One cluster of 8s forming an irregular shape.

**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (39)
    *   1: (2)
    *   8: (5)
*   objects: Same cluster of 8s as the input. Two single 1s appear adjacent to 8s.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 2
*   colors_changed: Two pixels changed from 8 to 1.

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding a single blue (1) pixel adjacent to each of two existing light-blue (8) pixels located at the edge of the cluster of light-blue pixels.  The specific placement seems to be the location adjacent to an existing light-blue (8) pixel and that are not themselves already light-blue (8).

To verify this hypothesis, we would need more examples to ensure there are no exceptions or variations to this pattern.  There could be other aspects which we have not yet observed.

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, followed by a refined hypothesis considering both examples:

**Example 2**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (41)
    *   8: (7)
*   objects: A larger, more complex cluster of 8s.

**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (38)
    *   1: (3)
    *   8: (7)
*   objects: Same cluster of 8s as the input. Three single 1s appear adjacent to 8s.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 3
*   colors_changed: Three pixels changed from 0 to 1.

**Transformation:**

The transformation is consistent with the initial hypothesis from Example 1:  a blue (1) pixel is added adjacent to each of three 8s at the edges of the cluster, ensuring that added 1s are not themselves 8s and are in fact adjacent to an 8.

**Refined Hypothesis (Based on Examples 1 and 2):**

The transformation rule appears to be:  For each 8 that is adjacent to at least one 0, add a 1 to an adjacent 0. The selection of which 0 to change to a 1 might depend on the orientation and shape of the cluster of 8s, or it may be arbitrary. It could be that we only modify 0s that are adjacent to only one 8. We need more examples to test these hypotheses.


**Next Steps:**

To strengthen the hypothesis, we need more examples, especially those with:

*   Different cluster sizes and shapes of 8s.
*   Clusters of 8s with different numbers of edge pixels adjacent to 0s (to discern the criteria for 1 placement).
*   Clusters of 8s with different numbers of 8s adjacent to each other.
*   Examples with different arrangements of 0s adjacent to the cluster, especially cases with numerous potential spots for 1s.  Do we pick the closest 0?  Is there a left-to-right or top-to-bottom preference?

By examining more diverse cases, we can refine the rule and identify any exceptions or nuances.
