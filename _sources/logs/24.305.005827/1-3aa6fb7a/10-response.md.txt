The current approach has failed to solve the puzzle due to an incomplete understanding of the rule governing the placement of the "1" pixels.  The code correctly identifies perimeter "8"s adjacent to "0"s, but it doesn't capture the logic behind selecting *which* adjacent "0" to transform into a "1".  This missing piece prevents accurate generation of the output grid.

To rectify this, we need more examples to uncover the underlying pattern.  The current examples do not provide sufficient data to deduce the complete rule.  The selection of the adjacent "0" to become a "1" seems non-arbitrary and likely depends on factors like the overall shape, orientation of the cluster, or additional spatial relationships within the grid that aren't readily apparent.

**Further Investigation Required:**

1.  **More Examples:**  Additional input-output pairs are essential for determining the complete rule.  The examples should include various cluster sizes, shapes, orientations, and arrangements of "0"s surrounding the "8" clusters.

2.  **Systematic Exploration:**  Once we have more data, a systematic analysis is needed.  This could involve:
    *   Visual inspection to identify potential patterns in the placement of "1"s relative to the "8" cluster and the neighboring "0"s.
    *   Code-based analysis to quantify spatial relationships between "8"s, "1"s, and "0"s.  This might involve calculating distances, analyzing adjacency patterns, and exploring other geometrical properties.

3.  **Refined Algorithm:**  Based on the findings from step 2, a more sophisticated algorithm can be developed to select the correct adjacent "0" for transformation.  This could involve rule-based systems, heuristic approaches, or machine learning models, depending on the complexity of the underlying pattern.


Without further examples, it's impossible to provide a more accurate and complete solution.  The current state of the solution is a partially correct approximation based on an incomplete rule.
