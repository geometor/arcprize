Based on the analysis and the unsuccessful submission attempts, it's clear that the current approach of simply placing a '1' in the first adjacent '0' encountered is insufficient. The rule for selecting the specific location of the '1' pixels is more complex than initially assumed, and additional examples are crucial to understand the underlying pattern.

Without more examples, it's impossible to definitively determine the complete rule for generating the output. The algorithm needs to be refined to incorporate the missing logic for choosing the correct location for the '1' pixels.  Additional examples would allow for a more complete and accurate rule to be derived.
