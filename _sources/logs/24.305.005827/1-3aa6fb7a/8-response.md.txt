The current working output grid is identical to the input grid.  This is incorrect, according to the hypothesis developed from the previous examples.  The solution should involve adding '1' pixels adjacent to perimeter '8's that are touching '0's.  The code in the previous step attempted to do this, but the result was not checked against the expected output before submission.  We need to revisit the process and ensure the algorithm for adding the '1' pixels is robust and accurately reflects the pattern observed in the examples.

Let's re-examine the code and make adjustments to improve the accuracy and completeness of the output:


code_execution:
```python
import numpy as np

def set_adjacent_ones(grid):
    grid_array = np.array(grid).copy() #create a copy to avoid modifying the original grid
    rows, cols = np.where(grid_array == 8)
    for r, c in zip(rows, cols):
        for dr, dc in [(0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0)]:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < len(grid_array) and 0 <= nc < len(grid_array[0]) and grid_array[nr, nc] == 0:
                grid_array[nr, nc] = 1
                break # Only set one '1' for each '8'
    return grid_array

test_input = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
              [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
              [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
              [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
              [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

updated_grid = set_adjacent_ones(test_input)
print(updated_grid)

```
code_execution_result: 1
```
[[1 0 0 0 1 8 8]
 [8 8 1 0 0 1 8]
 [8 1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 1 0 0]
 [0 0 1 8 8 1 0]
 [1 8 1 0 0 0 0]
 [8 8 1 0 0 0 0]]
```
This revised code produces a grid with '1's placed adjacent to perimeter '8's.  Let's use this as the updated working grid and resubmit.
