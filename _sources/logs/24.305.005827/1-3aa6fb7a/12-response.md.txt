The provided examples and the test case suggest a rule where a "1" is added adjacent to each "8" on the perimeter of an "8" cluster, *but the choice of which adjacent "0" becomes a "1" is not yet clear*.  The current attempts to solve the puzzle fail because they lack this crucial piece of information.

The current code tries to place a "1" next to any available "0" next to an "8", but this is clearly not the full rule, as demonstrated by the unsuccessful submissions.


To move forward, we absolutely need more examples to understand the subtle details of this rule.  The current examples do not reveal the logic behind choosing the specific location of the "1" pixels.  This is the critical missing link to a successful solution.
