## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (41)
    *   8: (5)
*   objects: One cluster of 8s forming an irregular shape.

**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (39)
    *   1: (2)
    *   8: (5)
*   objects: Same cluster of 8s as the input. Two single 1s appear adjacent to 8s.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 2
*   colors_changed: Two pixels changed from 8 to 1.

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding a single blue (1) pixel adjacent to each of two existing light-blue (8) pixels located at the edge of the cluster of light-blue pixels.  The specific placement seems to be the location adjacent to an existing light-blue (8) pixel and that are not themselves already light-blue (8).

To verify this hypothesis, we would need more examples to ensure there are no exceptions or variations to this pattern.  There could be other aspects which we have not yet observed.
