The puzzle cannot be solved without more examples to clarify the rule for selecting the location of the "1" pixels.  The current examples are insufficient to determine the complete transformation rule.  Additional input-output pairs are needed to reveal the underlying pattern that governs the placement of the "1"s.  The provided examples only show that a "1" is added near the perimeter of the "8" cluster, but they do not reveal the logic for choosing the exact location of the "1"s among the available "0"s.  A more sophisticated algorithm is needed to capture this missing logic.
