The puzzle cannot be solved with the given information.  The core issue is the insufficient number of examples to determine the complete rule for placing the "1" pixels.  While the rule of adding "1"s adjacent to perimeter "8"s is established, the selection criterion for choosing *which* adjacent "0" to transform is unknown.

The code attempts to address this by selecting the first available adjacent "0", but this heuristic is clearly insufficient.  The solutions are consistently incorrect because this heuristic does not capture the underlying pattern for "1" placement.  The missing information is the logic that governs the precise location of the new "1" pixels.

To achieve a successful solution, more examples are necessary. These examples should vary cluster sizes, shapes, orientations, and the arrangement of surrounding "0"s to allow for the extraction of a complete and accurate rule.  Once a more comprehensive set of examples is provided, the solution can be revisited with a refined algorithm for "1" pixel placement.  This could involve more sophisticated spatial analysis and pattern recognition techniques.
