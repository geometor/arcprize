The submission was unsuccessful.  The problem likely stems from the ambiguity in selecting which adjacent 0 to change to a 1. The rule, as currently understood, is incomplete. To solve this, more examples are needed to determine the exact criteria for selecting which adjacent 0 to transform.  The current code places a '1' in the first adjacent '0' it encounters when iterating through the neighboring cells. This may not always be the correct placement based on unobserved rules. A more sophisticated algorithm is required to correctly place the '1's.  Additional examples are crucial to reveal the missing aspects of the transformation rule.
