The puzzle cannot be solved without more examples to illustrate the rule governing the placement of the "1" pixels.  The current examples show that a "1" is added near perimeter "8"s, but they don't reveal the logic for choosing the exact location among available "0"s.  My attempts to solve the puzzle failed because my code's heuristic for placing "1"s (choosing the first available adjacent "0") is incorrect; this heuristic doesn't capture the underlying, unobserved pattern.  More examples are needed to deduce the complete transformation rule.
