## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1, focusing on identifying the transformation from input to output:

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (73)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (64)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels arranged in a cross pattern around the red pixel (positions (2,2), (2,4), (4,2), (4,4)).
    *   Four orange (7) pixels forming an L shape around the blue pixel (positions (5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)).


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around the existing red and blue pixels respectively.  The arrangement is symmetrical around the central pixels.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding new colored pixels around existing non-white pixels. The arrangement of the new pixels follows a specific pattern based on the location and color of the pre-existing pixels. The red pixel gets a yellow cross around it and the blue pixel gets an orange L shape around it.  This might be a distance-based pattern or adjacency based pattern, or both.  More examples are needed to determine the rules accurately.  There seems to be a consistent spatial relationship between the original pixels and the added pixels.


**Further investigation needed:**

To solidify the transformation rules, more examples are needed. Specifically, testing with different numbers, types, and arrangements of original pixels will help determine the rule comprehensively. For example, how does the pattern change if multiple coloured pixels are present or if they are closer together or further apart? The relationship between the position and added color is important and needs further investigation.

## observations:

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (68)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single azure (8) pixel at (0, 3)
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3, 2) and (6, 6)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (2, 6) and (7, 1)


**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (56)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (8)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single azure (8) pixel at (0, 3)
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3, 2) and (6, 6)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (2, 6) and (7, 1)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels surrounding the red pixels and forming a cross pattern around each
    *   Eight orange (7) pixels, mostly surrounding the blue pixels.  Each blue pixel gets an L shape of orange pixels.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 16
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around the existing red and blue pixels respectively.


**Transformation:**

The transformation is very similar to example 1.  Non-white pixels have new pixels added around them in a specific pattern.  The red pixels get yellow crosses, the blue pixels get orange L-shapes.  The azure pixel (8) remains unchanged.  This suggests that the transformation rule is applied independently to each colored pixel, irrespective of its neighbors or type.  The pattern of added pixels appears consistent with a spatial relationship related to the existing pixels.

**Comparison to Example 1:**

The transformation rules observed in both examples are consistent.  There is a predictable pattern of adding new pixels based on the color and location of existing non-white pixels.  This strengthens the hypothesis that the transformation operates independently on each coloured pixel.


**Further Considerations:**

*   **Distance and adjacency:** The exact distances and adjacency relationships between the original pixel and the added pixels need to be precisely determined.  Are the patterns always exactly the same shape and size, or do they adapt based on proximity to grid edges or other pixels?
*   **Edge effects:** How does the pattern handle pixels near the edges of the grid?  Do the patterns get truncated or modified?
*   **Multiple colored pixels:** Testing is needed to analyze the rule's behavior when more than one colored pixel is present in the input. Do the patterns overlap or interact?


To fully understand the rule, more examples with varying positions, numbers and proximity of colored pixels are crucial.
