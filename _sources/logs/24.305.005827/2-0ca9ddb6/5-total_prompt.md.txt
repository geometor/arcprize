## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1, focusing on identifying the transformation from input to output:

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (73)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (64)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels arranged in a cross pattern around the red pixel (positions (2,2), (2,4), (4,2), (4,4)).
    *   Four orange (7) pixels forming an L shape around the blue pixel (positions (5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)).


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around the existing red and blue pixels respectively.  The arrangement is symmetrical around the central pixels.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding new colored pixels around existing non-white pixels. The arrangement of the new pixels follows a specific pattern based on the location and color of the pre-existing pixels. The red pixel gets a yellow cross around it and the blue pixel gets an orange L shape around it.  This might be a distance-based pattern or adjacency based pattern, or both.  More examples are needed to determine the rules accurately.  There seems to be a consistent spatial relationship between the original pixels and the added pixels.


**Further investigation needed:**

To solidify the transformation rules, more examples are needed. Specifically, testing with different numbers, types, and arrangements of original pixels will help determine the rule comprehensively. For example, how does the pattern change if multiple coloured pixels are present or if they are closer together or further apart? The relationship between the position and added color is important and needs further investigation.

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (68)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single azure (8) pixel at (0, 3)
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3, 2) and (6, 6)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (2, 6) and (7, 1)


**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (56)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (8)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single azure (8) pixel at (0, 3)
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3, 2) and (6, 6)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (2, 6) and (7, 1)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels surrounding the red pixels and forming a cross pattern around each
    *   Eight orange (7) pixels, mostly surrounding the blue pixels.  Each blue pixel gets an L shape of orange pixels.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 16
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around the existing red and blue pixels respectively.


**Transformation:**

The transformation is very similar to example 1.  Non-white pixels have new pixels added around them in a specific pattern.  The red pixels get yellow crosses, the blue pixels get orange L-shapes.  The azure pixel (8) remains unchanged.  This suggests that the transformation rule is applied independently to each colored pixel, irrespective of its neighbors or type.  The pattern of added pixels appears consistent with a spatial relationship related to the existing pixels.

**Comparison to Example 1:**

The transformation rules observed in both examples are consistent.  There is a predictable pattern of adding new pixels based on the color and location of existing non-white pixels.  This strengthens the hypothesis that the transformation operates independently on each coloured pixel.


**Further Considerations:**

*   **Distance and adjacency:** The exact distances and adjacency relationships between the original pixel and the added pixels need to be precisely determined.  Are the patterns always exactly the same shape and size, or do they adapt based on proximity to grid edges or other pixels?
*   **Edge effects:** How does the pattern handle pixels near the edges of the grid?  Do the patterns get truncated or modified?
*   **Multiple colored pixels:** Testing is needed to analyze the rule's behavior when more than one colored pixel is present in the input. Do the patterns overlap or interact?


To fully understand the rule, more examples with varying positions, numbers and proximity of colored pixels are crucial.

## observations:

**Example 3:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (73)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   6: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (2, 2)
    *   A single magenta (6) pixel at (5, 6)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (7, 3)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (68)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   6: (1)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (2, 2)
    *   A single magenta (6) pixel at (5, 6)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (7, 3)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels in a cross around the red (2) pixel.
    *   Four orange (7) pixels in an L shape around the blue (1) pixel.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around the red (2) and blue (1) pixels, respectively.

**Transformation:**

The transformation in this example is consistent with the previous two.  The red pixel gets a yellow cross and the blue pixel gets an orange L-shape.  The magenta pixel remains unchanged.  This further supports the hypothesis that the transformation is applied independently to each colored pixel.


**Summary of Transformation Rules (Based on three examples):**

The transformation appears to be a local rule applied to each non-white pixel independently.  The rule involves adding new colored pixels around the existing colored pixels.

*   **Red (2):**  A yellow (4) cross pattern is added around it (pixels at a distance of one cell).
*   **Blue (1):** An orange (7) L-shape is added around it. (pixels at a distance of one cell).


**Unanswered Questions:**

*   **Other colors:**  We only observed red, blue, and magenta pixels in the examples, and the transformation was only observed for red and blue.  What happens to other colors (orange, yellow, green, etc.)?  Do they get the same treatment as red and blue?
*   **Pixel proximity:**  What happens when colored pixels are very close together?  Do the added pixels overlap?  Do they modify the pattern?
*   **Edge effects:** What happens if colored pixels are adjacent to the grid border?  Do the patterns get truncated?
*   **Multiple pixels of same color:**  What happens if there are multiple pixels of the same color in the input?

More examples are needed to answer these questions and fully define the transformation rule.  The current hypothesis is good, but not yet proven comprehensive.


# examples summary: 

Based on the three examples provided, the transformation from input to output grids follows a consistent pattern:

**Core Transformation:** The transformation is a local operation applied independently to each colored pixel (excluding white, color 0) in the input grid.  It does *not* appear to involve any global considerations, such as the overall arrangement of colors or relationships between different colored pixels.

**Specific Rules (Based on Observed Colors):**

* **Red (2):**  A yellow (4) cross is added. The cross is centered on the red pixel, with the yellow pixels located one cell away in the cardinal directions (north, south, east, west).

* **Blue (1):** An orange (7) L-shape is added. The L-shape is positioned adjacent to the blue pixel, extending one cell to the north, east and south.


**Color Invariance:** The magenta (6) and azure (8) pixels remain unchanged in the output grids.  This suggests that the transformation might be limited to red and blue pixels or might not be affected by all other colors in some way.

**Hypothesized General Rule:**  For each non-white pixel in the input, a specific pattern of new pixels is added based solely on the pixel's color and position.  This hypothesis requires further testing to validate or refine it.

```

The tool output confirms the observations from the visual inspection.  The analysis shows that the color counts change predictably, with the addition of yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels in the output grids. The `colored_pixels` list precisely locates the pixels and their colors in both input and output.  This data reinforces the hypothesis of a local transformation rule operating independently on each non-white pixel.  The next step would be to test this hypothesis with more examples, paying attention to edge effects and the interactions between closely spaced colored pixels.
