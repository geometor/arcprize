**Example 3:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (73)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   6: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (2, 2)
    *   A single magenta (6) pixel at (5, 6)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (7, 3)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (68)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   6: (1)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (2, 2)
    *   A single magenta (6) pixel at (5, 6)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (7, 3)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels in a cross around the red (2) pixel.
    *   Four orange (7) pixels in an L shape around the blue (1) pixel.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around the red (2) and blue (1) pixels, respectively.

**Transformation:**

The transformation in this example is consistent with the previous two.  The red pixel gets a yellow cross and the blue pixel gets an orange L-shape.  The magenta pixel remains unchanged.  This further supports the hypothesis that the transformation is applied independently to each colored pixel.


**Summary of Transformation Rules (Based on three examples):**

The transformation appears to be a local rule applied to each non-white pixel independently.  The rule involves adding new colored pixels around the existing colored pixels.

*   **Red (2):**  A yellow (4) cross pattern is added around it (pixels at a distance of one cell).
*   **Blue (1):** An orange (7) L-shape is added around it. (pixels at a distance of one cell).


**Unanswered Questions:**

*   **Other colors:**  We only observed red, blue, and magenta pixels in the examples, and the transformation was only observed for red and blue.  What happens to other colors (orange, yellow, green, etc.)?  Do they get the same treatment as red and blue?
*   **Pixel proximity:**  What happens when colored pixels are very close together?  Do the added pixels overlap?  Do they modify the pattern?
*   **Edge effects:** What happens if colored pixels are adjacent to the grid border?  Do the patterns get truncated?
*   **Multiple pixels of same color:**  What happens if there are multiple pixels of the same color in the input?

More examples are needed to answer these questions and fully define the transformation rule.  The current hypothesis is good, but not yet proven comprehensive.
