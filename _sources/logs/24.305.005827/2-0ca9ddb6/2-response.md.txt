**Example 2:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (68)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single azure (8) pixel at (0, 3)
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3, 2) and (6, 6)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (2, 6) and (7, 1)


**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (56)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (8)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single azure (8) pixel at (0, 3)
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3, 2) and (6, 6)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (2, 6) and (7, 1)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels surrounding the red pixels and forming a cross pattern around each
    *   Eight orange (7) pixels, mostly surrounding the blue pixels.  Each blue pixel gets an L shape of orange pixels.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 16
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around the existing red and blue pixels respectively.


**Transformation:**

The transformation is very similar to example 1.  Non-white pixels have new pixels added around them in a specific pattern.  The red pixels get yellow crosses, the blue pixels get orange L-shapes.  The azure pixel (8) remains unchanged.  This suggests that the transformation rule is applied independently to each colored pixel, irrespective of its neighbors or type.  The pattern of added pixels appears consistent with a spatial relationship related to the existing pixels.

**Comparison to Example 1:**

The transformation rules observed in both examples are consistent.  There is a predictable pattern of adding new pixels based on the color and location of existing non-white pixels.  This strengthens the hypothesis that the transformation operates independently on each coloured pixel.


**Further Considerations:**

*   **Distance and adjacency:** The exact distances and adjacency relationships between the original pixel and the added pixels need to be precisely determined.  Are the patterns always exactly the same shape and size, or do they adapt based on proximity to grid edges or other pixels?
*   **Edge effects:** How does the pattern handle pixels near the edges of the grid?  Do the patterns get truncated or modified?
*   **Multiple colored pixels:** Testing is needed to analyze the rule's behavior when more than one colored pixel is present in the input. Do the patterns overlap or interact?


To fully understand the rule, more examples with varying positions, numbers and proximity of colored pixels are crucial.
