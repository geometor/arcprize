Based on the three examples provided, the transformation from input to output grids follows a consistent pattern:

**Core Transformation:** The transformation is a local operation applied independently to each colored pixel (excluding white, color 0) in the input grid.  It does *not* appear to involve any global considerations, such as the overall arrangement of colors or relationships between different colored pixels.

**Specific Rules (Based on Observed Colors):**

* **Red (2):**  A yellow (4) cross is added. The cross is centered on the red pixel, with the yellow pixels located one cell away in the cardinal directions (north, south, east, west).

* **Blue (1):** An orange (7) L-shape is added. The L-shape is positioned adjacent to the blue pixel, extending one cell to the north, east and south.


**Color Invariance:** The magenta (6) and azure (8) pixels remain unchanged in the output grids.  This suggests that the transformation might be limited to red and blue pixels or might not be affected by all other colors in some way.

**Hypothesized General Rule:**  For each non-white pixel in the input, a specific pattern of new pixels is added based solely on the pixel's color and position.  This hypothesis requires further testing to validate or refine it.

The tool output confirms the observations from the visual inspection.  The analysis shows that the color counts change predictably, with the addition of yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels in the output grids. The `colored_pixels` list precisely locates the pixels and their colors in both input and output.  This data reinforces the hypothesis of a local transformation rule operating independently on each non-white pixel.  The next step would be to test this hypothesis with more examples, paying attention to edge effects and the interactions between closely spaced colored pixels.
