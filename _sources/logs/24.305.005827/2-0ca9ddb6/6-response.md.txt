Here's how to initialize the working output grid using the provided functions.  Given that the examples show relatively small changes between input and output grids (adding pixels around existing colored pixels), `initialize_output_from_input` is the more appropriate choice.  This leverages the existing structure of the input grid as a starting point, minimizing unnecessary operations.

code_execution:
```python
import numpy as np
from default_api import initialize_output_from_input

# Assuming test_input is defined from previous code execution
test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])


working_output_grid = initialize_output_from_input()
# Since initialize_output_from_input doesn't take input, we copy the test_input instead.

working_output_grid = np.copy(test_input)
print(working_output_grid)

```
