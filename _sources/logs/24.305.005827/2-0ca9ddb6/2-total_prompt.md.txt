## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1, focusing on identifying the transformation from input to output:

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (73)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (64)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels arranged in a cross pattern around the red pixel (positions (2,2), (2,4), (4,2), (4,4)).
    *   Four orange (7) pixels forming an L shape around the blue pixel (positions (5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)).


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around the existing red and blue pixels respectively.  The arrangement is symmetrical around the central pixels.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding new colored pixels around existing non-white pixels. The arrangement of the new pixels follows a specific pattern based on the location and color of the pre-existing pixels. The red pixel gets a yellow cross around it and the blue pixel gets an orange L shape around it.  This might be a distance-based pattern or adjacency based pattern, or both.  More examples are needed to determine the rules accurately.  There seems to be a consistent spatial relationship between the original pixels and the added pixels.


**Further investigation needed:**

To solidify the transformation rules, more examples are needed. Specifically, testing with different numbers, types, and arrangements of original pixels will help determine the rule comprehensively. For example, how does the pattern change if multiple coloured pixels are present or if they are closer together or further apart? The relationship between the position and added color is important and needs further investigation.
