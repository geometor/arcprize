Here's an analysis of example_1:

**input:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 43
    - 8: 5
  objects:
    - A single cluster of 8's, starting at (1,1) and extending to (4, 5).


**output:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 42
    - 8: 5
    - 1: 2
  objects:
    - A single cluster of 8's, as before.
    - Two 1's have appeared, one at (1,2) and one at (4,4).


**differences:**
  cells_changed: 2
  colors_changed: Two '1' pixels added.


**transformation:**
  - The transformation appears to involve adding a '1' in positions adjacent to the top-right and bottom-left corners of the primary cluster of '8's.  It seems to be selectively adding a blue(1)  adjacent to the existing group of azure(8) cells.  The addition is consistently one cell away from the corner '8's.  Further examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis and to determine whether this pattern extends to more complex arrangements.

To further investigate, we need more examples to check:

* **Edge cases:** What happens if the cluster of '8's is near the edge of the grid, preventing the addition of a '1'?
* **Larger clusters:** Does the rule still hold true if the cluster of '8's is larger?
* **Multiple clusters:** How does the transformation handle multiple separate clusters of '8's?
