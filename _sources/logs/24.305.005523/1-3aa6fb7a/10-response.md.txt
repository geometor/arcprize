The provided code is excellent and addresses many of the concerns I raised earlier. The improvements in cluster identification, deterministic corner selection, incremental updates, and error handling are significant steps toward creating a robust and reliable solution. The heatmaps are a great way to visualize the changes and confirm the correctness of each step. 

However,  the code still needs a few adjustments to fully integrate with the provided  `set_pixel` function and the overall puzzle-solving framework.  Here's a revised code incorporating these adjustments, along with a more detailed explanation of the changes.


```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

def find_clusters(grid):
    """Finds distinct clusters of 8's in a grid, handling edge cases."""
    # ... (This function remains unchanged from the previous version) ...
    return clusters

def add_ones(grid):
    """Adds '1's to corners of 8-clusters, avoiding edges."""
    clusters = find_clusters(grid)
    for cluster in clusters:
        min_row, min_col = min(cluster, key=lambda x: x[0])[0], min(cluster, key=lambda x: x[1])[1]
        max_row, max_col = max(cluster, key=lambda x: x[0])[0], max(cluster, key=lambda x: x[1])[1]

        # Prioritize corners not on edges; refined logic for corner selection
        if min_row > 0 and min_col > 0:
            row, col = min_row - 1, min_col - 1
        elif min_row > 0:
            row, col = min_row - 1, min_col
        elif min_col > 0:
            row, col = min_row, min_col - 1
        elif max_row < grid.shape[0] - 1 and max_col < grid.shape[1] - 1:
            row, col = max_row + 1, max_col + 1
        elif max_row < grid.shape[0] - 1:
            row, col = max_row + 1, max_col
        elif max_col < grid.shape[1] - 1:
            row, col = max_row, max_col + 1
        else:
            continue  # Skip if cluster is already in a corner

        try:
            # Integrate with the set_pixel function from the puzzle environment
            set_pixel(row, col, 1)  # Assuming set_pixel takes (row, col, value)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error setting pixel at ({row}, {col}): {e}")

def visualize_grid(grid):
    """Visualizes the grid using a heatmap."""
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    sns.heatmap(grid, annot=True, cmap="YlGnBu", cbar=False)
    plt.show()

# Initialize the output grid from the input.  Assume initialize_output_from_input() is provided.
initialize_output_from_input()  

# Get the current working grid (replace with your actual grid retrieval)
working_grid = get_working_grid()  # Placeholder; replace with actual function

# Apply the transformation
add_ones(working_grid)

#Visualize and Submit
visualize_grid(working_grid)
submit()

```

**Key Changes and Explanations:**

1. **Integration with `set_pixel`:** The code now directly uses `set_pixel(row, col, 1)` to update the grid.  This assumes that `set_pixel` is a function provided by the puzzle-solving environment and that it takes row, column, and value as arguments.  You'll need to replace the placeholder comment with the actual call to your `set_pixel` function.

2. **Error Handling:**  A `try-except` block is added to catch potential errors during `set_pixel` calls. This prevents the script from crashing if there's an issue with the coordinates or the `set_pixel` function itself.  It's essential for robust error management.

3. **`get_working_grid()`:**  A placeholder function `get_working_grid()` is introduced.  This function should be replaced with the actual function from your environment that retrieves the current state of the working output grid.


4. **Corner Selection Refinement:** The corner selection logic within `add_ones` is refined to be more deterministic and handle edge cases more effectively. This ensures that the '1's are always placed consistently at appropriate corners.

5. **Visualization:**  Heatmap visualization is retained to provide clear visual confirmation of the transformation at each step.


Remember to replace the placeholder comments with the correct function calls based on your specific puzzle-solving environment.  After making these adjustments, the code should be fully integrated and should provide a robust and reliable solution to this specific puzzle.  The use of heatmaps helps in debugging and verifying each step of the transformation.
