## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**input:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 43
    - 8: 5
  objects:
    - A single cluster of 8's, starting at (1,1) and extending to (4, 5).


**output:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 42
    - 8: 5
    - 1: 2
  objects:
    - A single cluster of 8's, as before.
    - Two 1's have appeared, one at (1,2) and one at (4,4).


**differences:**
  cells_changed: 2
  colors_changed: Two '1' pixels added.


**transformation:**
  - The transformation appears to involve adding a '1' in positions adjacent to the top-right and bottom-left corners of the primary cluster of '8's.  It seems to be selectively adding a blue(1)  adjacent to the existing group of azure(8) cells.  The addition is consistently one cell away from the corner '8's.  Further examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis and to determine whether this pattern extends to more complex arrangements.

To further investigate, we need more examples to check:

* **Edge cases:** What happens if the cluster of '8's is near the edge of the grid, preventing the addition of a '1'?
* **Larger clusters:** Does the rule still hold true if the cluster of '8's is larger?
* **Multiple clusters:** How does the transformation handle multiple separate clusters of '8's?

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, following the same format as example_1:

**input:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 40
    - 8: 8
  objects:
    - Multiple clusters of '8's.  No single large connected cluster.


**output:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 37
    - 8: 8
    - 1: 3
  objects:
    - Multiple clusters of '8's, as before.
    - Three '1's have appeared, each adjacent to a corner of an '8' cluster.


**differences:**
  cells_changed: 3
  colors_changed: Three '1' pixels added.


**transformation:**
  - The transformation again involves adding '1's.  This time, there are multiple clusters of 8s.  For *each* cluster, it appears a '1' is added adjacent to a corner of the cluster.  Specifically, it seems to consistently add blue (1) cells adjacent to the corners of the existing azure (8) cell clusters. The addition is consistently one cell away from the corner 8's.

**Comparison with Example 1 and Refinement of Hypothesis:**

Both examples strongly support the hypothesis that the transformation adds blue (1) pixels adjacent to the corners of existing clusters of azure (8) pixels.  The number of added '1's appears to be related to the number of clusters and the clusters' number of corners (that are not against the grid edge).  Further testing with different cluster shapes and sizes is needed to solidify this hypothesis.  It also seems that the selection of which corner the blue pixel is added to is nondeterministic.


**Further Testing Considerations:**

* **Edge cases:**  What happens when a cluster is directly on an edge or in a corner of the grid?  Will a '1' be added only to corners not touching the grid edge?
* **Cluster shapes:**  Clusters of different shapes should be tested. Are there specific adjacency rules, or is it just any corner?
* **Cluster proximity:** What if two clusters are very close together? Does the addition of '1' still occur independently for each cluster?
* **Larger grids:**  Does the pattern scale to larger grids?

The transformation rule is beginning to appear fairly consistent and predictable.  The next step is to test it with a new input grid.
