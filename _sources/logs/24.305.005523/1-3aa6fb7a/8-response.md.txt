The solution is correct.  The final working output grid accurately reflects the transformation rule identified from the examples: adding a '1' to a corner of each cluster of '8's, avoiding edges where possible. The heatmaps effectively visualized the changes. The process of incremental changes and verification after each `set_pixel` call ensured accuracy and helped in debugging if there had been any errors.  The use of `numpy` and `matplotlib` significantly aided in analyzing the grids and visualizing the changes.  The `find_clusters` function proved invaluable for automating the identification of clusters in the input grid.
