Based on the examples, there are significant differences between the input and output grids.  The output grid retains the original colors but adds new cross patterns. Therefore, it's more appropriate to initialize the output grid using `initialize_output_from_input`. This ensures that the initial state of the output grid matches the input, providing a base for adding the cross patterns.  I will use this function to proceed with the test.

code_execution:


function_call:

initialize_output_from_input


result:

initialize_output_from_input()
