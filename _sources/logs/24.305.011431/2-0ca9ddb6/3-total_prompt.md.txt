## observations:

Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (72)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2).
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6).


**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (64)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2) remains unchanged.
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6,6) remains unchanged.
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels form a cross pattern centered around the red pixel.
    *   Four orange (7) pixels form a cross pattern around the blue pixel.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow and orange pixels in cross patterns around the red and blue pixels, respectively.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding cross patterns of yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around existing red (2) and blue (1) pixels.  The cross patterns extend one pixel outward in each direction (north, south, east, west) from each original colored pixel. This is not a "one-to-one" mapping, as there's no simple rule to determine the color of the added pixels.  The transformation rules could be summarized as follows:


1.  Identify the existing blue (1) and red (2) pixels.
2.  For each red pixel, add yellow (4) pixels one square orthogonally away.
3.  For each blue pixel, add orange (7) pixels one square orthogonally away.



This transformation seems to depend on the presence of a color as a trigger to add new colors.  There appears to be no simple formula to determine the location of the new pixels from the position of the original pixels. The relative location and count of the new colors are consistent though.


To confirm, we need to see more examples.  Are there ever multiple red or blue pixels? What happens then? Does the pattern extend if the initial red or blue pixel is near an edge?  Does the pattern extend if the initial pixels are closer than 2 spaces apart?

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example 2, followed by a revised understanding of the transformation rules based on both examples:

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (68)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single azure (8) pixel at (3, 0).
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (2, 3) and (6, 6).
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (2, 7) and (6, 2).


**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (56)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (8)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   The azure (8), blue (1), and red (2) pixels from the input remain in the same positions.
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels form a cross around each of the two red (2) pixels.
    *   Eight orange (7) pixels form crosses around each of the two blue (1) pixels.  Note: these crosses are more spread out to avoid overlaps.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 16
*   colors_changed: Added yellow and orange pixels, again in cross patterns around red and blue pixels, respectively.

**Transformation (Revised):**

Based on both examples, the transformation can be summarized as follows:

1.  **Identify Seed Pixels:** The rule is triggered by the presence of red (2) and blue (1) pixels (seed pixels).  The location and quantity of these seed pixels appear not to affect the transformation.  Other colors appear to be ignored.

2.  **Add Cross Patterns:**
    *   For each red (2) pixel, a cross pattern of four yellow (4) pixels is added orthogonally adjacent.
    *   For each blue (1) pixel, a cross pattern of four orange (7) pixels is added orthogonally adjacent.


3.  **Collision Handling:** If crosses from different seed pixels overlap (as is the case with the blue pixels in Example 2), the orange pixels are simply added to fill the spaces, not to overwrite existing pixels.  This implies that the addition of pixels occurs sequentially, rather than simultaneously.

4. **Edge Handling:**  When the cross patterns of yellow or orange pixels are on the edge of the grid, they don't extend beyond it.


**Next Steps:**

To further solidify our understanding, we need to test these hypotheses with more examples.  Specifically, we should consider testing cases with:

*   More than two red or blue pixels.
*   Red and blue pixels closer together.
*   Red and blue pixels positioned near edges of the grid.
*   The presence of other colors that are not blue or red.


Once we have tested these more edge cases, we can build a more robust model.
