Example 3 Analysis:

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (72)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   6: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (2, 2).
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (7, 3).
    *   A single magenta (6) pixel at (5, 6).

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (64)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   6: (1)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   The red (2), blue (1), and magenta (6) pixels remain unchanged.
    *   A cross of four yellow (4) pixels around the red (2) pixel.
    *   A cross of four orange (7) pixels around the blue (1) pixel.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow and orange pixels in crosses around red and blue pixels.

**Transformation:**

This example confirms the previously hypothesized transformation rules. The magenta (6) pixel is irrelevant; only red (2) and blue (1) pixels trigger the addition of yellow (4) and orange (7) crosses, respectively.  The transformation continues to be consistent with the previous examples.  The addition of pixels only happens around the blue and red pixels.


**Overall Conclusion (Based on all three examples):**

The transformation is consistently adding yellow and orange crosses orthogonally adjacent to red and blue pixels respectively. The process does not overwrite pixels and works its way around existing pixels (as seen in example 2).  Additional colors are ignored.  Therefore, a robust function can be made to accurately reflect this consistent transformation.
