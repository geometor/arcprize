Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (72)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2).
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6).


**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (64)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2) remains unchanged.
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6,6) remains unchanged.
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels form a cross pattern centered around the red pixel.
    *   Four orange (7) pixels form a cross pattern around the blue pixel.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow and orange pixels in cross patterns around the red and blue pixels, respectively.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding cross patterns of yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around existing red (2) and blue (1) pixels.  The cross patterns extend one pixel outward in each direction (north, south, east, west) from each original colored pixel. This is not a "one-to-one" mapping, as there's no simple rule to determine the color of the added pixels.  The transformation rules could be summarized as follows:


1.  Identify the existing blue (1) and red (2) pixels.
2.  For each red pixel, add yellow (4) pixels one square orthogonally away.
3.  For each blue pixel, add orange (7) pixels one square orthogonally away.



This transformation seems to depend on the presence of a color as a trigger to add new colors.  There appears to be no simple formula to determine the location of the new pixels from the position of the original pixels. The relative location and count of the new colors are consistent though.


To confirm, we need to see more examples.  Are there ever multiple red or blue pixels? What happens then? Does the pattern extend if the initial red or blue pixel is near an edge?  Does the pattern extend if the initial pixels are closer than 2 spaces apart?
