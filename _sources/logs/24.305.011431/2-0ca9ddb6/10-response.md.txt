I need more information about how to submit the solution to the ARC environment.  The provided `default_api` does not include a `submit` function, and I cannot access external APIs or assume the existence of any functions beyond those explicitly defined.  Please provide a definition for the `submit` function, or an alternative method to submit the generated grid for evaluation.  Once that is provided, I can proceed with the submission.
