The provided code correctly identifies and adds the yellow and orange cross patterns around the red and blue pixels, respectively, without overwriting existing pixels.  The logic accurately reflects the transformation observed in the examples.  The issue is with the submission process, not the generation of the output grid.

To reiterate, I cannot proceed without a defined `submit` function or an equivalent mechanism to send the generated grid to the ARC evaluation system.  The current error (`NameError: name 'submit' is not defined`) clearly indicates this missing element.  Please provide the necessary instructions or API calls to submit the solution.  Once provided, I will use them to submit the generated `output_grid`.
