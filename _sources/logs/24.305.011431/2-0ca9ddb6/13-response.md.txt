I understand.  The problem is that the `submit` function is undefined in the context of this exercise. To proceed, I need either:

1.  A definition for a `submit` function that takes the `output_grid` (NumPy array) as input and interacts with the ARC environment to submit the solution. This function should ideally return some indicator of success or failure (e.g., a boolean value, or a specific status code from the ARC API).

2.  Instructions on how to directly interact with the ARC environment using an alternative method (API calls, a specific file format, etc.) that would allow me to submit the `output_grid` for evaluation.  I need a clear description of the submission process and format.

Once I have either of these, I can complete the puzzle.  Currently, my code generates the correct output grid; only the submission is blocked by the lack of a `submit` function or alternative submission mechanism.
