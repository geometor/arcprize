I cannot proceed without a definition for the `submit` function or an equivalent submission mechanism.  My code generates the correct output grid (as demonstrated in previous responses), but the submission process is blocked by the lack of a defined `submit` function in the `default_api`.  Please provide the necessary API calls or function definition to interact with the ARC environment and submit the solution.
