The current working output grid is identical to the test input grid.  No changes have been made to it yet.  To proceed, we need to add the yellow and orange cross patterns around the red and blue pixels, respectively, using a function that avoids overwriting existing pixels.

Here's the refined code to add the cross patterns:



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

def add_cross(grid, row, col, color, new_color):
    height, width = grid.shape
    if 0 <= row < height and 0 <= col < width and grid[row, col] == 0:
        grid[row, col] = new_color
    if 0 <= row - 1 < height and 0 <= col < width and grid[row - 1, col] == 0:
        grid[row - 1, col] = new_color
    if 0 <= row + 1 < height and 0 <= col < width and grid[row + 1, col] == 0:
        grid[row + 1, col] = new_color
    if 0 <= row < height and 0 <= col - 1 < width and grid[row, col - 1] == 0:
        grid[row, col - 1] = new_color
    if 0 <= row < height and 0 <= col + 1 < width and grid[row, col + 1] == 0:
        grid[row, col + 1] = new_color

test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

output_grid = np.copy(test_input)

for r in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
    for c in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
        if output_grid[r, c] == 2:
            add_cross(output_grid, r, c, 2, 4)
        if output_grid[r, c] == 1:
            add_cross(output_grid, r, c, 1, 7)

print(output_grid)

```

code_execution_result: 1

```
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0]
 [0 0 4 0 0 7 1 7 0]
 [0 4 2 4 0 0 7 0 0]
 [0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0]
 [0 6 0 0 0 0 4 2 4]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0]]

```

This `output_grid` represents the solution based on the established rules.  However,  I still need a mechanism to submit this solution.  Without a defined `submit` function or instructions on how to interact with the ARC environment to submit the solution, I cannot proceed further. Please provide the missing submission instructions or a `submit` function definition.
