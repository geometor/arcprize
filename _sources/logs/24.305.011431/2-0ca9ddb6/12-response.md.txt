The `default_api` does not contain a `submit` function.  To proceed, I need a definition for a `submit` function or an alternative way to submit the solution to the ARC environment.  The current code generates the correct output grid based on the examples provided, but it lacks the necessary functionality to interact with the ARC system for submission and evaluation. Please provide the missing `submit` function definition or an equivalent submission method.
