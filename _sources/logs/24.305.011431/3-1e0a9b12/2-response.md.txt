Here's an analysis of example_2, following the same format as example_1:

**input:**
  - width: 6
  - height: 6
  - colors:
    - 0: 28
    - 4: 3
    - 7: 2
    - 8: 2
    - 9: 1
  - objects:
    - Yellow (4): Three vertically stacked single pixels at (3,0), (4,0), (5,0).
    - Orange (7): Two vertically stacked single pixels at (4,2), (5,2).
    - Azure (8): Two pixels at (1,3), (4,3).
    - Maroon (9): Single pixel at (0,5).


**output:**
  - width: 6
  - height: 6
  - colors:
    - 0: 30
    - 4: 3
    - 7: 2
    - 8: 2
    - 9: 1
  - objects:
    - Yellow (4): Three vertically stacked single pixels at (3,0), (4,0), (5,0).
    - Orange (7): Two vertically stacked single pixels at (4,4), (5,4).
    - Azure (8): Two pixels at (4,4), (5,4).
    - Maroon (9): Single pixel at (5,5).

**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 4
  - colors_changed: The non-zero colored pixels from the bottom-right section of the input are moved to the bottom-right corner, maintaining their relative positions.


**transformation:**
  - Similar to example 1, this example also shows a "gathering" or "collection" transformation. The colored pixels in the bottom-right quadrant of the input are moved to the bottom-right corner of the output grid, maintaining their relative positions.  The rest of the grid is filled with white (0).  There's a slight difference; the movement isn't as strictly "bottom-right" as in example 1, but rather the preservation of relative positions is the key.

**Overall Pattern Hypothesis:**

Based on the two examples, the transformation appears to involve identifying a cluster of non-zero colored pixels (potentially defined by proximity, but not always a contiguous block), then moving this cluster to the bottom-right corner of the grid, while preserving their internal spatial relationships.  The rest of the grid is filled with white (0).  The size and shape of the initial cluster aren't directly defining the transformation, but rather the relative locations of the pixels within that cluster are preserved in the final output.
