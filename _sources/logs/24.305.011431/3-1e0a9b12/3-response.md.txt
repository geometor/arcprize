Here's an analysis of example_3, following the same format as the previous examples:

**input:**
  - width: 5
  - height: 5
  - colors:
    - 0: 18
    - 1: 2
    - 2: 1
    - 3: 3
    - 6: 1
  - objects:
    - Blue (1): Two pixels at (3,0) and (2,3).
    - Red (2): One pixel at (2,4).
    - Green (3): Three vertically stacked pixels at (1,1), (2,1), (4,1).
    - Magenta (6): One pixel at (3,0).


**output:**
  - width: 5
  - height: 5
  - colors:
    - 0: 20
    - 1: 2
    - 2: 1
    - 3: 3
    - 6: 1
  - objects:
    - Blue (1): Two pixels at (3,3), (4,3).
    - Red (2): One pixel at (4,4).
    - Green (3): Three vertically stacked pixels at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2).
    - Magenta (6): One pixel at (4,0).

**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 10
  - colors_changed: The colored pixels are shifted down and to the right, maintaining their relative positions to each other.  The bottom-right quadrant contains the most significant concentration of the colors.


**transformation:**
  - The transformation in this example is also a form of "gathering," but with a different pattern compared to the first two examples. Instead of strictly moving to the bottom-right corner, the group of colored pixels seems to shift diagonally downward and to the right while preserving their relative spatial relationships.  The shift appears to be a translation, aimed at positioning the cluster toward the bottom-right, but the precise coordinates are slightly different from the previous examples.


**Revised Overall Pattern Hypothesis:**

The transformation consistently involves preserving the relative positions of non-zero colored pixels. However, the target location for this "gathered" cluster is not consistently the extreme bottom-right corner.  Instead, the algorithm appears to attempt to shift the cluster toward the bottom-right while maintaining the relative positioning of pixels within that cluster. The degree of movement and the final positioning might be influenced by the size and shape of the initial cluster and the available space in the bottom-right quadrant.  Further examples are needed to refine this hypothesis and better define the movement algorithm.
