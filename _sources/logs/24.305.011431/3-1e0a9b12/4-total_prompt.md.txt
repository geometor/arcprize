## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**input:**
  - width: 4
  - height: 4
  - colors:
    - 0: 10
    - 1: 1
    - 4: 2
    - 6: 1
    - 9: 1
  - objects:
    - Yellow (4):  Two separate single pixels located at (0,1) and (2,1).
    - Maroon (9): Single pixel at (0,3)
    - Blue (1): Single pixel at (3,0)
    - Magenta (6): Single pixel at (2,2)


**output:**
  - width: 4
  - height: 4
  - colors:
    - 0: 12
    - 1: 1
    - 4: 2
    - 6: 1
    - 9: 1
  - objects:
    - Yellow (4): Two single pixels located at (2,1) and (3,1).
    - Maroon (9): Single pixel at (3,3)
    - Blue (1): Single pixel at (3,0)
    - Magenta (6): Single pixel at (3,2)

**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 8
  - colors_changed: The non-zero colored pixels are moved to the bottom row, preserving their relative positions to each other.


**transformation:**
  - The non-zero colored pixels are collected and moved to the bottom-right corner of the grid, maintaining their relative positions to one another.  The rest of the grid is filled with white (0).  It appears to be a type of "gathering" or "collection" transformation.

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, following the same format as example_1:

**input:**
  - width: 6
  - height: 6
  - colors:
    - 0: 28
    - 4: 3
    - 7: 2
    - 8: 2
    - 9: 1
  - objects:
    - Yellow (4): Three vertically stacked single pixels at (3,0), (4,0), (5,0).
    - Orange (7): Two vertically stacked single pixels at (4,2), (5,2).
    - Azure (8): Two pixels at (1,3), (4,3).
    - Maroon (9): Single pixel at (0,5).


**output:**
  - width: 6
  - height: 6
  - colors:
    - 0: 30
    - 4: 3
    - 7: 2
    - 8: 2
    - 9: 1
  - objects:
    - Yellow (4): Three vertically stacked single pixels at (3,0), (4,0), (5,0).
    - Orange (7): Two vertically stacked single pixels at (4,4), (5,4).
    - Azure (8): Two pixels at (4,4), (5,4).
    - Maroon (9): Single pixel at (5,5).

**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 4
  - colors_changed: The non-zero colored pixels from the bottom-right section of the input are moved to the bottom-right corner, maintaining their relative positions.


**transformation:**
  - Similar to example 1, this example also shows a "gathering" or "collection" transformation. The colored pixels in the bottom-right quadrant of the input are moved to the bottom-right corner of the output grid, maintaining their relative positions.  The rest of the grid is filled with white (0).  There's a slight difference; the movement isn't as strictly "bottom-right" as in example 1, but rather the preservation of relative positions is the key.

**Overall Pattern Hypothesis:**

Based on the two examples, the transformation appears to involve identifying a cluster of non-zero colored pixels (potentially defined by proximity, but not always a contiguous block), then moving this cluster to the bottom-right corner of the grid, while preserving their internal spatial relationships.  The rest of the grid is filled with white (0).  The size and shape of the initial cluster aren't directly defining the transformation, but rather the relative locations of the pixels within that cluster are preserved in the final output.

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_3, following the same format as the previous examples:

**input:**
  - width: 5
  - height: 5
  - colors:
    - 0: 18
    - 1: 2
    - 2: 1
    - 3: 3
    - 6: 1
  - objects:
    - Blue (1): Two pixels at (3,0) and (2,3).
    - Red (2): One pixel at (2,4).
    - Green (3): Three vertically stacked pixels at (1,1), (2,1), (4,1).
    - Magenta (6): One pixel at (3,0).


**output:**
  - width: 5
  - height: 5
  - colors:
    - 0: 20
    - 1: 2
    - 2: 1
    - 3: 3
    - 6: 1
  - objects:
    - Blue (1): Two pixels at (3,3), (4,3).
    - Red (2): One pixel at (4,4).
    - Green (3): Three vertically stacked pixels at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2).
    - Magenta (6): One pixel at (4,0).

**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 10
  - colors_changed: The colored pixels are shifted down and to the right, maintaining their relative positions to each other.  The bottom-right quadrant contains the most significant concentration of the colors.


**transformation:**
  - The transformation in this example is also a form of "gathering," but with a different pattern compared to the first two examples. Instead of strictly moving to the bottom-right corner, the group of colored pixels seems to shift diagonally downward and to the right while preserving their relative spatial relationships.  The shift appears to be a translation, aimed at positioning the cluster toward the bottom-right, but the precise coordinates are slightly different from the previous examples.


**Revised Overall Pattern Hypothesis:**

The transformation consistently involves preserving the relative positions of non-zero colored pixels. However, the target location for this "gathered" cluster is not consistently the extreme bottom-right corner.  Instead, the algorithm appears to attempt to shift the cluster toward the bottom-right while maintaining the relative positioning of pixels within that cluster. The degree of movement and the final positioning might be influenced by the size and shape of the initial cluster and the available space in the bottom-right quadrant.  Further examples are needed to refine this hypothesis and better define the movement algorithm.
