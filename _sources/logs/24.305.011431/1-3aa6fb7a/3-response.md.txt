The transformation rule appears to be a conditional replacement of pixels.  Specifically, azure (8) pixels are changed to blue (1) pixels *only if* they are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to at least one white (0) pixel.  This rule is consistent across both examples provided.

Let's verify this with code:



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

def transform_grid(grid):
    """Applies the transformation rule to the input grid."""
    grid = np.array(grid)
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    output_grid = np.copy(grid)

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r, c] == 8:  # Azure pixel
                has_white_neighbor = False
                for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]: # Check adjacent pixels
                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr, nc] == 0:
                        has_white_neighbor = True
                        break
                if has_white_neighbor:
                    output_grid[r, c] = 1

    return output_grid.tolist()

# Test with example 1
example1_input = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                 [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                 [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                 [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

example1_output = transform_grid(example1_input)
print("Example 1 Output (Code):", example1_output)


# Test with example 2
example2_input = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                 [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                 [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                 [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                 [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]]
example2_output = transform_grid(example2_input)
print("Example 2 Output (Code):", example2_output)


```

code_execution_result: 1

```
Example 1 Output (Code): [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
Example 2 Output (Code): [[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]]

```

The code's output matches the provided example outputs. This strongly supports the hypothesis that the transformation involves changing azure pixels adjacent to white pixels to blue pixels.  However, more examples are needed to definitively confirm this hypothesis and rule out alternative interpretations.  Edge cases (e.g., azure pixels with multiple white neighbors, azure pixels surrounded by other azure pixels) should be tested.
