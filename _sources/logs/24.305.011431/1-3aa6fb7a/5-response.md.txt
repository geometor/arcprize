The examples show that the output grid is very similar to the input grid, differing only in a few pixels.  Therefore, it's appropriate to use `initialize_output_from_input` to initialize the working output grid.  Since there's no function signature or further information available for that function, I'll assume it returns a copy of the input grid.

code_execution:


function_call:

initialize_output_from_input


result:

initialize_output_from_input()
