The working output grid shows the initial state before applying the transformation rule.  Let's verify the changes using code, comparing it to the predicted final grid:



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

initial_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                        [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                        [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

final_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8],
                        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
                        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
                        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

diff = initial_grid - final_grid
print(f'{np.count_nonzero(diff)=}') # Number of changed pixels
print(f'{np.unique(diff)=}')       # Values of changes (should be 0 and 7, indicating 8->1)


```

code_execution_result: 1

```
np.count_nonzero(diff)=11
np.unique(diff)=array([0, 7])

```

The tool output confirms that 11 pixels changed, and the change was from 8 (azure) to 1 (blue), precisely as predicted by the transformation rule.  This verifies that the changes made to the `working_grid` are consistent with the rule and the final predicted grid.  The puzzle is complete.
