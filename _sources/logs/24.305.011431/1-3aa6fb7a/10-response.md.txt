The working output grid shows the initial state before applying the transformation rule. To confirm the changes are consistent, let's re-run the code that identifies pixels to change and then compare to the final predicted grid.



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

working_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                        [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                        [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

azure_coords = []
rows, cols = working_grid.shape
for r in range(rows):
    for c in range(cols):
        if working_grid[r, c] == 8:
            for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and working_grid[nr, nc] == 0:
                    azure_coords.append((r,c))
                    break

print(f'{azure_coords=}')

final_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8],
                        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
                        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
                        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

#Check if the pixels identified by azure_coords are changed to 1 in final_grid
for r,c in azure_coords:
    if final_grid[r,c] !=1:
        print(f'Error: Pixel at ({r},{c}) should be 1 but is {final_grid[r,c]}')


```

code_execution_result: 1

```
azure_coords=[(0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 0), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1)]

```

The tool output confirms that the `azure_coords` list correctly identifies all azure pixels adjacent to white pixels. The subsequent check within the tool code would have verified that each of these pixels was correctly changed to blue (1) in the `final_grid`.  Since there was no error message printed, this confirms that the changes made to the `working_grid` are consistent with the transformation rule. The solution is complete.
