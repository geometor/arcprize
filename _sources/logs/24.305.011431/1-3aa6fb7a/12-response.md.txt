The provided `working_grid` is the initial state before applying the transformation.  Let's verify the changes using code:



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

initial_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                        [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                        [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

final_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8],
                        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
                        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
                        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

diff = initial_grid - final_grid
print(f'{np.count_nonzero(diff)=}')
print(f'{np.unique(diff)=}')


```

code_execution_result: 1

```
np.count_nonzero(diff)=11
np.unique(diff)=array([0, 7])

```

The tool output shows that there are 11 non-zero elements in the difference array (`diff`), indicating 11 pixels have changed.  The unique values in `diff` are 0 and 7, confirming that the change was from 8 (azure) to 1 (blue) in each of these 11 locations.  This matches the prediction and confirms the changes are consistent with the transformation rule. The solution is complete.
