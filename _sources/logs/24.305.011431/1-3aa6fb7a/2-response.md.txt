Here's an analysis of example_2, followed by a refined hypothesis about the transformation rule:

**example_2:**

**input:**

* width: 7
* height: 7
* colors:
    - 0: (40)
    - 8: (8)
* objects:
    - A cluster of 8 'azure' pixels forming an irregular 'L' shape.


**output:**

* width: 7
* height: 7
* colors:
    - 0: (36)
    - 8: (8)
    - 1: (4)
* objects:
    - The cluster of azure pixels remains.
    - Four 'blue' pixels appear, each seemingly replacing an 'azure' pixel adjacent to a white pixel


**differences:**

* cells_changed: 4
* colors_changed: Four azure pixels changed to blue.


**transformation:**

* Similar to example 1, azure pixels are changed to blue. The rule seems to be that *azure pixels that are adjacent to a white pixel are transformed into blue pixels*.


**Refined Transformation Hypothesis:**

Based on both examples, the transformation rule appears to be:  Identify all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.  For each azure pixel, check its immediate neighbors (horizontally and vertically adjacent). If at least one of its neighbors is a white (0) pixel, change the azure pixel to blue (1).


**Next Steps:**

To further validate this hypothesis, more examples are needed.  Specifically, examples that test edge cases such as:

* Azure pixels with multiple white neighbors
* Azure pixels completely surrounded by other azure pixels
* Azure clusters with different shapes and sizes
* The effect of diagonal neighbors (although the examples suggest only horizontal and vertical adjacency matters)

Once a comprehensive set of examples is tested against this refined hypothesis, the algorithm will be refined if needed.
