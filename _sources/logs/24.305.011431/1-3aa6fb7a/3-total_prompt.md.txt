## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**input:**

* width: 7
* height: 7
* colors:
    - 0: (40)
    - 8: (6)
* objects:
    - A cluster of 6 'azure' pixels forming an irregular shape.


**output:**

* width: 7
* height: 7
* colors:
    - 0: (38)
    - 8: (6)
    - 1: (2)
* objects:
    - The cluster of azure pixels remains.
    - Two 'blue' pixels appear; one adjacent to an azure pixel at (1, 1) and another at (4, 4).


**differences:**

* cells_changed: 2
* colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue.


**transformation:**

* The transformation appears to involve changing some of the azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels.  The locations of the changes are not immediately obvious, but they might relate to the edges or corners of the azure cluster. More examples are needed to confirm the rule.  One possible hypothesis is that some azure pixels adjacent to white are changed to blue.  Another is that the transformation selects specific azure pixels in the input image based on their position and replaces them with blue.  Further examples are needed to understand the underlying algorithm.

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, followed by a refined hypothesis about the transformation rule:

**example_2:**

**input:**

* width: 7
* height: 7
* colors:
    - 0: (40)
    - 8: (8)
* objects:
    - A cluster of 8 'azure' pixels forming an irregular 'L' shape.


**output:**

* width: 7
* height: 7
* colors:
    - 0: (36)
    - 8: (8)
    - 1: (4)
* objects:
    - The cluster of azure pixels remains.
    - Four 'blue' pixels appear, each seemingly replacing an 'azure' pixel adjacent to a white pixel


**differences:**

* cells_changed: 4
* colors_changed: Four azure pixels changed to blue.


**transformation:**

* Similar to example 1, azure pixels are changed to blue. The rule seems to be that *azure pixels that are adjacent to a white pixel are transformed into blue pixels*.


**Refined Transformation Hypothesis:**

Based on both examples, the transformation rule appears to be:  Identify all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.  For each azure pixel, check its immediate neighbors (horizontally and vertically adjacent). If at least one of its neighbors is a white (0) pixel, change the azure pixel to blue (1).


**Next Steps:**

To further validate this hypothesis, more examples are needed.  Specifically, examples that test edge cases such as:

* Azure pixels with multiple white neighbors
* Azure pixels completely surrounded by other azure pixels
* Azure clusters with different shapes and sizes
* The effect of diagonal neighbors (although the examples suggest only horizontal and vertical adjacency matters)

Once a comprehensive set of examples is tested against this refined hypothesis, the algorithm will be refined if needed.


# examples summary: 

- summarize your observations to explain the transformation of the input to output

- use code_execution to investigate properties, patterns and differences in the grids
