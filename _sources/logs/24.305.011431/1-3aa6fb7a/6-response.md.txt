The working output grid is initialized correctly as a copy of the input grid.  This is consistent with the strategy of modifying the input grid to create the output grid.  The next step will be to iteratively change pixels according to the refined transformation rule.

code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

working_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                        [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                        [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

# Check the number of azure pixels adjacent to white pixels.

count = 0
rows, cols = working_grid.shape
for r in range(rows):
    for c in range(cols):
        if working_grid[r, c] == 8:
            for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and working_grid[nr, nc] == 0:
                    count +=1
                    break
print(f'{count=}')


```

code_execution_result: 1

```
count=11

```

There are 11 azure pixels adjacent to white pixels in the working grid.  This matches the prediction from the previous code execution, confirming that the initialization is correct and that the transformation rule should result in 11 changes from azure to blue.  I will proceed with iteratively modifying the working grid using the `set_pixel` function (assuming it takes row, column, and color as arguments) to change these pixels to blue.
