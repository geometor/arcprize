Here's an analysis of example_1:

**input:**

* width: 7
* height: 7
* colors:
    - 0: (40)
    - 8: (6)
* objects:
    - A cluster of 6 'azure' pixels forming an irregular shape.


**output:**

* width: 7
* height: 7
* colors:
    - 0: (38)
    - 8: (6)
    - 1: (2)
* objects:
    - The cluster of azure pixels remains.
    - Two 'blue' pixels appear; one adjacent to an azure pixel at (1, 1) and another at (4, 4).


**differences:**

* cells_changed: 2
* colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue.


**transformation:**

* The transformation appears to involve changing some of the azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels.  The locations of the changes are not immediately obvious, but they might relate to the edges or corners of the azure cluster. More examples are needed to confirm the rule.  One possible hypothesis is that some azure pixels adjacent to white are changed to blue.  Another is that the transformation selects specific azure pixels in the input image based on their position and replaces them with blue.  Further examples are needed to understand the underlying algorithm.
