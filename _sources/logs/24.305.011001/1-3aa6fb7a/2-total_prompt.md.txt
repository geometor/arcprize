## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**input:**
  - width: 7
  - height: 7
  - colors:
    - 0: (40)
    - 8: (6)
  - objects:
    - A single cluster of 8s, starting at (1,1) and extending down and to the right

**output:**
  - width: 7
  - height: 7
  - colors:
    - 0: (38)
    - 8: (6)
    - 1: (2)
  - objects:
    - Same cluster of 8s as input.
    - Two additional `1` pixels; one adjacent to the top-right 8, the other adjacent to the bottom-right 8.

**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 2
  - colors_changed: Two pixels changed from 0 (white) to 1 (blue).  These pixels are located at positions (1,2) and (4,4).  Both pixels are adjacent to a pixel containing an 8.

**transformation:**
  - It appears that the transformation adds a blue (1) pixel to the right and below each isolated 8.  The added pixels are directly adjacent to the 8s.  Additional examples will clarify if this is the consistent rule.

To confirm the pattern and refine the transformation rule, more examples are needed.  Specifically, I'd like to see examples:


1. With multiple clusters of 8s to see how the rule is applied in such cases
2. To determine if the location of "1" depends on the cluster orientation.
3. That examine the behaviour of the rule near edges.  Does it apply in the same way?
