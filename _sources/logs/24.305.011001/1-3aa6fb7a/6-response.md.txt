The working output grid is correctly initialized from the input grid.  The next step is to add the "1" pixels according to the established transformation rule.  Let's use the `transform_grid` function from the previous code execution to modify the working grid.


code_execution:
```python
import numpy as np

def transform_grid(grid):
    grid = np.array(grid)
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r,c] == 8:
                surrounded = True
                if r > 0 and grid[r-1, c] != 8: surrounded = False
                if r < rows - 1 and grid[r+1, c] != 8: surrounded = False
                if c > 0 and grid[r, c-1] != 8: surrounded = False
                if c < cols - 1 and grid[r, c+1] != 8: surrounded = False

                if not surrounded:
                    if c + 1 < cols and grid[r, c+1] == 0:
                        grid[r, c+1] = 1
                    if r + 1 < rows and grid[r+1, c] == 0:
                        grid[r+1, c] = 1
    return grid


working_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                      [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])


final_grid = transform_grid(working_grid)
print(final_grid)

```
code_execution_result: 1
```
[[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]
 [8 8 1 0 0 1 8]
 [8 1 0 0 0 0 1]
 [1 0 0 8 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 1 0]
 [0 8 1 1 1 0 0]
 [8 8 1 0 0 0 0]]
```

The code execution shows the final grid after applying the transformation.  This matches the prediction made earlier.  I am ready to submit this solution.

submission:
[[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]
 [8 8 1 0 0 1 8]
 [8 1 0 0 0 0 1]
 [1 0 0 8 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 1 0]
 [0 8 1 1 1 0 0]
 [8 8 1 0 0 0 0]]
