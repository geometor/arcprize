## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**input:**
  - width: 7
  - height: 7
  - colors:
    - 0: (40)
    - 8: (6)
  - objects:
    - A single cluster of 8s, starting at (1,1) and extending down and to the right

**output:**
  - width: 7
  - height: 7
  - colors:
    - 0: (38)
    - 8: (6)
    - 1: (2)
  - objects:
    - Same cluster of 8s as input.
    - Two additional `1` pixels; one adjacent to the top-right 8, the other adjacent to the bottom-right 8.

**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 2
  - colors_changed: Two pixels changed from 0 (white) to 1 (blue).  These pixels are located at positions (1,2) and (4,4).  Both pixels are adjacent to a pixel containing an 8.

**transformation:**
  - It appears that the transformation adds a blue (1) pixel to the right and below each isolated 8.  The added pixels are directly adjacent to the 8s.  Additional examples will clarify if this is the consistent rule.

To confirm the pattern and refine the transformation rule, more examples are needed.  Specifically, I'd like to see examples:


1. With multiple clusters of 8s to see how the rule is applied in such cases
2. To determine if the location of "1" depends on the cluster orientation.
3. That examine the behaviour of the rule near edges.  Does it apply in the same way?

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, building on the observations from example_1:

**input:**
  - width: 7
  - height: 7
  - colors:
    - 0: (40)
    - 8: (8)
  - objects:
    - Multiple clusters of 8s.

**output:**
  - width: 7
  - height: 7
  - colors:
    - 0: (36)
    - 8: (8)
    - 1: (4)
  - objects:
    - Same clusters of 8s as input.
    - Four additional `1` pixels; one added adjacent to each isolated 8 (right and below).

**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 4
  - colors_changed: Four pixels changed from 0 (white) to 1 (blue).  Each is adjacent to an 8.

**transformation:**
  - The transformation rule is consistent with example_1.  For each isolated 8 (that is not immediately surrounded by more 8s on all four sides) a blue pixel (1) is added directly to the right and below.  This holds true even with multiple, unconnected clusters of 8s.  The position of the added 1s is independent of the orientation or position of the clusters.

**Refined Transformation Rule:**

For every pixel with value 8 that is not completely surrounded by other 8s (horizontally and vertically), add a pixel with value 1 to the right and below the 8 if the space is available (i.e., does not exceed the grid boundary).


This rule seems consistent across the examples, and addresses the initial questions raised after reviewing example_1.  No further examples seem necessary at this time to clarify the rule.  If additional examples are provided, it may strengthen the conclusion of the pattern; however, this transformation rule explains both examples with high confidence.


# examples summary: 

- summarize your observations to explain the transformation of the input to output

- use code_execution to investigate properties, patterns and differences in the grids
