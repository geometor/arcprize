Here's an analysis of example_2, building on the observations from example_1:

**input:**
  - width: 7
  - height: 7
  - colors:
    - 0: (40)
    - 8: (8)
  - objects:
    - Multiple clusters of 8s.

**output:**
  - width: 7
  - height: 7
  - colors:
    - 0: (36)
    - 8: (8)
    - 1: (4)
  - objects:
    - Same clusters of 8s as input.
    - Four additional `1` pixels; one added adjacent to each isolated 8 (right and below).

**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 4
  - colors_changed: Four pixels changed from 0 (white) to 1 (blue).  Each is adjacent to an 8.

**transformation:**
  - The transformation rule is consistent with example_1.  For each isolated 8 (that is not immediately surrounded by more 8s on all four sides) a blue pixel (1) is added directly to the right and below.  This holds true even with multiple, unconnected clusters of 8s.  The position of the added 1s is independent of the orientation or position of the clusters.

**Refined Transformation Rule:**

For every pixel with value 8 that is not completely surrounded by other 8s (horizontally and vertically), add a pixel with value 1 to the right and below the 8 if the space is available (i.e., does not exceed the grid boundary).


This rule seems consistent across the examples, and addresses the initial questions raised after reviewing example_1.  No further examples seem necessary at this time to clarify the rule.  If additional examples are provided, it may strengthen the conclusion of the pattern; however, this transformation rule explains both examples with high confidence.
