## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1, focusing on identifying the transformation from input to output:

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (73)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (64)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels forming a cross pattern around the red pixel.
    *   Four orange (7) pixels forming an L shape around the blue pixel.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels.  The original red (2) and blue (1) pixels remain in the same position.

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve the addition of new colored pixels around the existing red and blue pixels. The pattern of the added pixels suggests a "halo" or expansion effect, specific to each color.  Yellow surrounds the red pixel in a cross pattern, and orange surrounds the blue pixel in an L shape. There's no obvious mathematical or geometric relationship between the positions of original and added pixels that could be expressed with simple math.


**Next Steps:**

To confirm this transformation, more examples are needed.  I need to see if the pattern of adding yellow and orange pixels consistently expands around the red and blue pixels, respectively, regardless of their position in the input grid, or if other colors behave in a similar manner.   Also, it needs to be checked whether the patterns of yellow and orange are consistent.
