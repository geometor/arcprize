**Example 3:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (73)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   6: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (2, 2)
    *   A single magenta (6) pixel at (5, 6)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (7, 3)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (64)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   6: (1)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (2, 2)
    *   A single magenta (6) pixel at (5, 6)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (7, 3)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels forming a cross pattern around the red (2) pixel.
    *   Four orange (7) pixels forming a cross pattern around the blue (1) pixel.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels. The original red (2), magenta (6), and blue (1) pixels remain in the same position.

**Transformation:**

The transformation in Example 3 follows the same pattern as in Examples 1 and 2.  Yellow (4) pixels form a cross around red (2) pixels, and orange (7) pixels form a cross around blue (1) pixels. The magenta (6) pixel remains unchanged.  This strongly suggests that the transformation is consistent and color-specific.

**Ruminate Phase (Updated):**

The three examples strongly support the hypothesis that the transformation adds halo pixels around specific colors:

*   Red (2) always gets a yellow (4) cross.
*   Blue (1) always gets an orange (7) cross.

Other colors (e.g., magenta, azure) remain unchanged in the examples provided.


**Hypothesis Refinement:**

The transformation rule seems to be that for a given input grid:
1. Identify all occurrences of red (2) pixels.  Add a yellow (4) cross pattern around each of them.  The cross pattern spans the 4 cells surrounding the red pixel.
2. Identify all occurrences of blue (1) pixels. Add an orange (7) cross pattern around each of them.  The cross pattern spans the 4 cells surrounding the blue pixel.
3. All other pixels remain unchanged.


**Next Steps:**

To further validate the hypothesis, additional examples are needed.  It would be particularly helpful to have examples testing boundary conditions, such as:

*   What happens when the halos overlap?
*   What happens if a red or blue pixel is at the edge of the grid?
*   Are there any other colors that trigger similar halo effects?
*   Are the shapes of the halos always cross-shaped (for yellow and orange)? Or can other patterns emerge depending on the pixel's position?

Further examples will help to improve the robustness and generality of the hypothesis and lead to a more precise and complete description of the puzzle's rules.
