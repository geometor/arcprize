**Example 2:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (68)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single azure (8) pixel at (3, 0)
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3, 3) and (6, 6)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (2, 6) and (7, 1)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (56)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (8)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single azure (8) pixel at (3, 0)
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3, 3) and (6, 6)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (2, 6) and (7, 1)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels forming a cross pattern around each red pixel.
    *   Eight orange (7) pixels surrounding each blue pixel in an extended 'plus' pattern.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 16
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around existing red and blue pixels.  The original azure (8), red (2), and blue (1) pixels remain in the same position.

**Transformation:**

The transformation is consistent with Example 1.  Yellow pixels are added around red pixels in a cross shape, and orange pixels are added around blue pixels, but in a different arrangement, forming a more extensive plus sign around each.  The pattern of the added pixels is still a "halo" or expansion effect specific to each color.   Again, there's no simple mathematical or geometric rule evident based on the pixel coordinates themselves.


**Ruminate Phase:**

Based on the two examples, a tentative hypothesis is that the transformation involves adding "halo" pixels around certain colors:

*   Red (2) gets a cross-shaped halo of yellow (4) pixels.
*   Blue (1) gets a plus-shaped halo of orange (7) pixels.

This hypothesis needs further testing with more examples to confirm if it is correct and if there are exceptions or additional rules. The shapes and placement of the added pixels around red and blue pixels do seem to be consistent so far, despite their placement.


**Next Steps:**

To further test the hypothesis, I need more examples.  I especially need examples that address the following questions:

*   What happens if the original colored pixels are closer together or clustered?  Do the halos overlap or interact?
*   What happens if there are more than one pixel of the colors of interest (red and blue)?
*   Are other colors treated similarly? Do they have their own halo effects?
*   Do the relative positions of pixels within each pattern influence the generation of new pixels? Are there any exceptions to the patterns observed?

More examples will allow for a stronger confirmation or refutation of the hypothesis.
