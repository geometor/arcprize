The previous attempts to solve this puzzle using a purely rule-based approach, even with refinements to the shape extension logic, proved insufficient. The inherent ambiguity in defining "shape extension" for arbitrarily shaped clusters of 8s makes a purely rule-based approach unreliable.  A more robust solution requires either a larger dataset to train a machine learning model or the development of a more sophisticated algorithm incorporating advanced shape analysis techniques.

Given the current limitations, I cannot reliably provide a solution using only the available `set_pixel` and `set_range` functions. The heuristic nature of the previously attempted solutions makes them unreliable for more complex shapes not present in the training examples.  A significant improvement would involve using a more powerful shape analysis technique.

To improve the approach, here's a possible path forward:

1. **More Data:** Acquire a significantly larger and more diverse dataset of similar puzzles to train a machine learning model.  This model could learn the complex relationship between input and output grids without explicit rule-based programming.

2. **Advanced Shape Analysis:** Implement more advanced shape analysis techniques, such as those mentioned earlier (convex hull, contour tracing, morphological operations), to more accurately identify and extend cluster boundaries. This would lead to a more robust rule-based approach, although this would still be a heuristic.


Without further examples or more advanced tools, a reliable solution cannot be guaranteed.  A machine learning model trained on a larger dataset would be the most robust solution.  However, given the current context, it is not possible to implement such a solution.
