## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (5)
*   objects: One cluster of 8s with a roughly rectangular shape.


**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (38)
    *   8: (5)
    *   1: (2)
*   objects:  Similar to the input, but with two additional '1' pixels.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 2
*   colors_changed: Two '0' pixels changed to '1' pixels.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve replacing certain '0' pixels adjacent to '8' pixels with '1' pixels. Specifically, it seems to add '1' pixels to the bottom right and top right corners of the primary cluster of '8's.  There is no obvious geometric or numerical pattern beyond adjacency, so it may be a simple rule based on object relationships and proximity.

To verify, we need to see more examples and confirm if the pattern of adding '1' in corners holds true for different sizes and positions of the '8' cluster.
