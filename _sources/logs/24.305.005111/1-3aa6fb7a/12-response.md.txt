The final submitted grid was incorrect.  The `extend_clusters` function, while a reasonable attempt at capturing the transformation rule, suffered from an oversimplification of the shape extension logic. The heuristic used to determine whether adding a '1' constitutes extending the boundary of the cluster was insufficiently precise.  It simply checked if the proposed '1' was on the minimum or maximum row or column of the 8 cluster.  A more sophisticated approach is needed to capture the nuances of shape extension more reliably.  The algorithm works well on simple cases, but fails in cases that involve more complex shapes.

To improve this solution, more examples would be required to build a more robust and accurate algorithm.  Additionally, incorporating more advanced shape analysis methods would greatly improve the accuracy.  Possible advanced methods include:

* **Convex Hull:** Calculate the convex hull of each cluster of '8's to more precisely define the cluster's boundary.
* **Contour Tracing:** Use algorithms such as Freeman chain code to trace the contours of the clusters and add '1's along the contour to more accurately extend the shapes.
* **Morphological Operations:**  Utilize morphological operations (like dilation or erosion) to refine the shapes and boundaries of the clusters.
* **Machine Learning:** Train a machine learning model on a sufficiently large and diverse dataset of input-output pairs. This is arguably the most robust approach, especially if the underlying rule is complex or not fully understood.


In summary, while the provided solution made a valiant attempt to capture the essence of the puzzle's transformation, a more robust and sophisticated approach is needed for a general solution.  The inherent ambiguity in the concept of "shape extension" makes heuristic solutions prone to error. A more formal mathematical or machine learning-based approach is likely necessary for solving similar puzzles with more reliability.
