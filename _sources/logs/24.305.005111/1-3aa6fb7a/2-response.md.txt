Here's an analysis of example_2, followed by a synthesis of both examples:

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (7)
*   objects: A more dispersed cluster of '8's than in example 1.


**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (36)
    *   8: (7)
    *   1: (4)
*   objects: Similar to the input, but with four added '1' pixels.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 4
*   colors_changed: Four '0' pixels changed to '1' pixels.


**Transformation:**

The transformation is consistent with example 1. It adds '1' pixels adjacent to the '8' pixels.  The '1' pixels appear to be added to locations that extend the overall cluster but aren't directly adjacent to other '8' pixels within the main cluster.

**Synthesis of Examples 1 and 2:**

Both examples demonstrate the same core transformation: adding '1' pixels adjacent to, but slightly extending, the primary cluster of '8' pixels. The rule isn't about adding '1' to *all* adjacent '0' pixels, but rather to those '0' pixels which could reasonably be interpreted as extending the existing shape formed by the '8' pixels.  There appears to be an implicit notion of object boundary extension.


**Revised Transformation Hypothesis:**

For each 8, add a 1 to adjacent 0 cells that extend a perceived boundary of the collection of 8s. The boundary extension favors extending lines, so it is not likely to fill in corners where there is not already a "line" of 8s in the existing cluster.
