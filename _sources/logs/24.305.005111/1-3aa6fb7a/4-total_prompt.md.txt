## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (5)
*   objects: One cluster of 8s with a roughly rectangular shape.


**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (38)
    *   8: (5)
    *   1: (2)
*   objects:  Similar to the input, but with two additional '1' pixels.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 2
*   colors_changed: Two '0' pixels changed to '1' pixels.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve replacing certain '0' pixels adjacent to '8' pixels with '1' pixels. Specifically, it seems to add '1' pixels to the bottom right and top right corners of the primary cluster of '8's.  There is no obvious geometric or numerical pattern beyond adjacency, so it may be a simple rule based on object relationships and proximity.

To verify, we need to see more examples and confirm if the pattern of adding '1' in corners holds true for different sizes and positions of the '8' cluster.

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, followed by a synthesis of both examples:

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (7)
*   objects: A more dispersed cluster of '8's than in example 1.


**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (36)
    *   8: (7)
    *   1: (4)
*   objects: Similar to the input, but with four added '1' pixels.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 4
*   colors_changed: Four '0' pixels changed to '1' pixels.


**Transformation:**

The transformation is consistent with example 1. It adds '1' pixels adjacent to the '8' pixels.  The '1' pixels appear to be added to locations that extend the overall cluster but aren't directly adjacent to other '8' pixels within the main cluster.

**Synthesis of Examples 1 and 2:**

Both examples demonstrate the same core transformation: adding '1' pixels adjacent to, but slightly extending, the primary cluster of '8' pixels. The rule isn't about adding '1' to *all* adjacent '0' pixels, but rather to those '0' pixels which could reasonably be interpreted as extending the existing shape formed by the '8' pixels.  There appears to be an implicit notion of object boundary extension.


**Revised Transformation Hypothesis:**

For each 8, add a 1 to adjacent 0 cells that extend a perceived boundary of the collection of 8s. The boundary extension favors extending lines, so it is not likely to fill in corners where there is not already a "line" of 8s in the existing cluster.


# examples summary: 

The transformation rule appears to be adding `1` pixels to the input grid based on the location of `8` pixels.  The added `1` pixels extend the perceived boundary of the cluster of `8`s, but don't fill in gaps or add to areas that wouldn't naturally extend the shape.  This suggests an implicit understanding of object boundaries and shape extension.

Let's examine the adjacency more closely using code:



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

def analyze_adjacency(input_grid):
    """Analyzes adjacency of 8s and 0s in a grid."""
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_array.shape
    eights_indices = np.where(input_array == 8)
    zeros_indices = np.where(input_array == 0)

    eight_neighbors = {}
    for i, j in zip(*eights_indices):
        neighbors = []
        for x, y in [(i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1)]: #check adjacent cells
            if 0 <= x < rows and 0 <= y < cols:
                neighbors.append((x,y))
        eight_neighbors[(i,j)] = neighbors

    adjacent_zeros = {}
    for k,v in eight_neighbors.items():
        zeros_adjacent = []
        for x,y in v:
            if input_array[x,y] == 0:
                zeros_adjacent.append((x,y))
        adjacent_zeros[k] = zeros_adjacent

    return eight_neighbors, adjacent_zeros

```

The code identifies adjacent zeros for each `8` in the input grids.  Observing the output grids, the `1`s are placed at a subset of these adjacent zeros.  The selection isn't random; it appears to prioritize extending the existing shape formed by the `8`s, rather than filling in all adjacent zeros indiscriminately.  A more sophisticated analysis would be needed to fully define the rule governing this shape extension.  A more complex algorithm incorporating concepts of shape and boundary would likely perform better than a simple adjacency check.  We would need more examples to fully elucidate this rule.
