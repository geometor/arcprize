The puzzle has been solved and the solution has been submitted.  The `extend_clusters` function, while a heuristic approach, produced a solution that was accepted by the `submit` function.  However, it is important to remember that this approach has limitations and might not be universally applicable to similar problems.  More sophisticated shape analysis techniques would be necessary to create a truly robust solution.
