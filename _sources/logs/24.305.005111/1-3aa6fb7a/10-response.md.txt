The provided code uses connected component analysis to identify clusters of 8s and then attempts to extend these clusters by adding 1s to adjacent 0s that are on the boundaries of the identified clusters. However, the shape extension logic is still relatively simple. A more sophisticated algorithm that incorporates more robust shape analysis techniques (e.g., convex hull, contour tracing) would likely lead to more accurate results.  The code's current shape analysis just checks if a proposed 1 is on the minimum or maximum row or column of the 8 cluster.   A more sophisticated algorithm would use a more comprehensive assessment of the shape of the cluster to decide whether or not adding a 1 is a boundary extension.

The current approach produces a plausible solution based on the observed pattern in the examples, but it is not foolproof.  To truly solve this problem robustly requires a much more general-purpose algorithm capable of understanding object shapes.  The provided examples are relatively simple.   More complex examples with unusual cluster shapes would likely lead to more significant errors.

To improve the solution, consider these approaches:

1. **More Data:** Gathering more diverse examples would allow for a more robust model to be trained.
2. **Advanced Shape Analysis:**  Use sophisticated image processing and computer vision techniques, such as contour detection, convex hull, or morphological operations, to accurately identify the clusters and their boundaries.
3. **Machine Learning:** Train a machine learning model on a large dataset of similar transformation tasks to learn the intricate relationship between input and output.


Given the limitations of the current approach, we'll submit the output from the `extend_clusters` function, recognizing that this is a heuristic solution that might not be optimal and is not guaranteed to produce perfect results in all cases.
