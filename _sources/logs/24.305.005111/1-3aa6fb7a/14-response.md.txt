The analysis of the provided examples and the test input revealed a pattern of adding '1' pixels to extend the perceived boundaries of clusters of '8' pixels. However, accurately capturing this "shape extension" proved challenging using a purely rule-based approach. The heuristic used in the `extend_clusters` function, while providing a reasonable approximation, failed to handle the nuances of shape extension for more complex cluster configurations. The submission was therefore incorrect.

To significantly improve the solution, two main avenues are recommended:

1. **More Data:** Gathering more examples with diverse cluster shapes and arrangements would enable the training of a robust machine learning model capable of learning the complex mapping between input and output grids without explicit rule definition.  This is likely the most robust solution.

2. **Advanced Shape Analysis:** Implementing advanced shape analysis techniques, such as those mentioned earlier, would greatly enhance the accuracy of a rule-based approach.  This is a potentially more challenging path, requiring more sophisticated algorithms.


Currently, without access to a larger dataset or the ability to implement sophisticated shape analysis algorithms, a reliable solution cannot be guaranteed. The limitations of the available tools restrict the possibilities of what algorithms can be easily implemented. The previous attempts demonstrate the difficulty of capturing the implicit rule purely through programmatic heuristics.  A more powerful approach, such as machine learning, is needed for a general solution to this puzzle.
