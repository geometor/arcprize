The puzzle cannot be reliably solved with the current tools and the limited number of examples. The heuristic approach used previously, while providing a reasonable approximation for simple cases, failed to generalize to more complex shapes in the test input. A more robust solution requires either a larger dataset for machine learning or significantly more sophisticated shape analysis algorithms beyond the capabilities of the current tools.  The problem lies in the inherent ambiguity in defining "shape extension" without a more precise definition or a larger dataset to learn that definition from.
