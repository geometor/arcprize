Updated Working Output Grid:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0]
 [0 0 4 0 0 7 1 7 0]
 [0 4 2 4 0 0 7 0 0]
 [0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0]
 [0 6 0 0 0 0 4 2 4]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0]]

```

The updated grid shows the addition of yellow and orange crosses around the red and blue pixels respectively. The cross patterns extend one pixel in each cardinal direction where there is not an existing pixel. This aligns with my understanding of the transformation.  The magenta and azure pixels remain unchanged.


I am ready to submit.
