## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1, focusing on identifying the transformation rules:

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (73)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (61)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels forming a cross around the red (2) pixel
    *   Four orange (7) pixels forming a square around the blue (1) pixel


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels; original pixels remain.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding new colored pixels around existing pixels.  Specifically:

*   A single red (2) pixel triggers the creation of a yellow (4) cross pattern around it. The pattern is centered at the original red pixel.
*   A single blue (1) pixel triggers the creation of an orange (7) square pattern around it. The pattern is centered at the original blue pixel.

**Hypothesis:**

The rule seems to be context-dependent, applying different patterns based on the color of the existing pixel. More examples are needed to verify this hypothesis and to check if there are other colors and pattern types.  The position of the new pixels relative to the existing pixel is also important in defining the specific pattern.

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, building upon the observations from example_1:

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (66)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single azure (8) pixel at (3, 3)
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3, 3) and (6, 6)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (2, 6) and (7, 1)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (50)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   4: (6)
    *   7: (8)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single azure (8) pixel at (3, 3)
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3, 3) and (6, 6)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (2, 6) and (7, 1)
    *   Six yellow (4) pixels surrounding the red pixels in a cross pattern
    *   Eight orange (7) pixels surrounding the blue pixels in a cross pattern


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 14
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around existing pixels.

**Transformation:**

The transformation is consistent with example_1.  The rule seems to be:

*   For each blue (1) pixel, add an orange (7) cross pattern around it.
*   For each red (2) pixel, add a yellow (4) cross pattern around it.
*   The azure (8) pixel remains unchanged.


**Refinement of Hypothesis:**

The hypothesis from example_1 is strengthened by example_2.  The transformation appears to be a color-specific pattern addition rule.  The patterns added are cross patterns and the color of the new pixels depends on the color of the existing pixel. More examples would further solidify this and check for exceptions.  The next step would be to investigate other colors to see if they also have associated patterns.

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_3, building upon the observations from previous examples:

**Example 3:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (73)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   6: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (2, 2)
    *   A single magenta (6) pixel at (5, 6)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (7, 3)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (65)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   6: (1)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (2, 2)
    *   A single magenta (6) pixel at (5, 6)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (7, 3)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels forming a cross around the red (2) pixel.
    *   Four orange (7) pixels forming a cross around the blue (1) pixel.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around existing red and blue pixels, respectively.


**Transformation:**

The transformation is consistent with the previous examples.  The rule remains:

*   For each blue (1) pixel, add an orange (7) cross pattern around it.
*   For each red (2) pixel, add a yellow (4) cross pattern around it.
*   Other colors (magenta (6) in this case) remain unchanged.


**Refinement of Hypothesis:**

Example 3 further solidifies the hypothesis that the transformation involves adding color-specific cross patterns around certain pixels (red and blue).  Magenta is currently not part of this.  More examples are needed to confirm whether this is a complete set of rules or whether other colors exist with their own patterns. We should also investigate whether the patterns change based on the surrounding pixels or have further conditions.
