Here's an analysis of example_2, building upon the observations from example_1:

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (66)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single azure (8) pixel at (3, 3)
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3, 3) and (6, 6)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (2, 6) and (7, 1)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (50)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   4: (6)
    *   7: (8)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single azure (8) pixel at (3, 3)
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3, 3) and (6, 6)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (2, 6) and (7, 1)
    *   Six yellow (4) pixels surrounding the red pixels in a cross pattern
    *   Eight orange (7) pixels surrounding the blue pixels in a cross pattern


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 14
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around existing pixels.

**Transformation:**

The transformation is consistent with example_1.  The rule seems to be:

*   For each blue (1) pixel, add an orange (7) cross pattern around it.
*   For each red (2) pixel, add a yellow (4) cross pattern around it.
*   The azure (8) pixel remains unchanged.


**Refinement of Hypothesis:**

The hypothesis from example_1 is strengthened by example_2.  The transformation appears to be a color-specific pattern addition rule.  The patterns added are cross patterns and the color of the new pixels depends on the color of the existing pixel. More examples would further solidify this and check for exceptions.  The next step would be to investigate other colors to see if they also have associated patterns.
