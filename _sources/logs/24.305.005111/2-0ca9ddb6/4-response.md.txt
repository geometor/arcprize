The transformation applied in all three examples involves adding new pixels around specific colors in the input grid to generate the output grid.  The rules appear to be:

1.  **Red (2) Pixel Rule:** If a red (2) pixel exists in the input, a cross pattern of yellow (4) pixels is added around it.  The cross extends one pixel in each direction (horizontally and vertically) from the red pixel.

2.  **Blue (1) Pixel Rule:** If a blue (1) pixel exists in the input, a cross pattern of orange (7) pixels is added around it.  The cross extends one pixel in each direction (horizontally and vertically) from the blue pixel.

3.  **Other Colors:** Other colors in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.

Let's verify these rules using code to analyze the provided examples:

```python

import numpy as np

example_1_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

example_1_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                            [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                            [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                            [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0],
                            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 1, 7, 0],
                            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0],
                            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

# Function to check for cross pattern around a specified color
def check_cross(grid, color, pattern_color):
    rows, cols = np.where(grid == color)
    for r, c in zip(rows, cols):
        if r > 0 and grid[r - 1, c] != pattern_color: return False
        if r < grid.shape[0] - 1 and grid[r + 1, c] != pattern_color: return False
        if c > 0 and grid[r, c - 1] != pattern_color: return False
        if c < grid.shape[1] - 1 and grid[r, c + 1] != pattern_color: return False
    return True

#Verification for Example 1
print(f"Example 1: Red cross (yellow): {check_cross(example_1_output, 2, 4)}")
print(f"Example 1: Blue cross (orange): {check_cross(example_1_output, 1, 7)}")

#Repeat for other examples (code omitted for brevity, but similar checks would be performed)

```

code_execution_result: 1

```
Example 1: Red cross (yellow): False
Example 1: Blue cross (orange): True

```

The code indicates a problem. My initial hypothesis was incomplete, and the cross pattern isn't always strictly one pixel in each direction.  Let's refine the hypothesis.  The orange cross around the blue pixel is accurate, but the yellow pattern around the red pixel is more complex in Example 1,  requiring further investigation.  We'll need to analyze all the examples more carefully, looking for more nuanced patterns and rules, possibly taking into account the surrounding pixels or other factors.  The function `check_cross` needs to be adapted to deal with the more varied patterns.  We'll re-examine the examples with a focus on edge conditions and variability in pattern size to refine the transformation rules.
