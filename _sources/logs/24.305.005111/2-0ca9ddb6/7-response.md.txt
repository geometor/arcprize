The working output grid is correctly initialized as a copy of the input grid.  This is a good starting point, as the transformation primarily involves adding pixels, not removing or changing existing ones.

Let's use code to verify the initialization and to further refine the rules for adding the cross patterns:




code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

working_output = np.copy(test_input)

print("Working Output Grid:")
print(working_output)

#Verify that working_output is identical to test_input.
assert np.array_equal(working_output, test_input), "Initialization failed"
print("Initialization successful")



```

code_execution_result: 1

```
Working Output Grid:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0]
 [0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 6 0 0 0 0 0 2 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
Initialization successful

```

The code confirms that the `working_output` grid is a perfect copy of the `test_input` grid, successfully completing the initialization.  The next step is to iteratively add the cross patterns.  We'll proceed one color at a time, starting with the red and blue pixels, using a more robust function to add cross patterns. The updated function will account for edge conditions, and attempt to improve its accuracy.
