Here's how to initialize the working output grid for the test case.  Given that the examples show a relatively small number of changes between input and output (primarily the addition of cross patterns), initializing the output from the input is the more suitable approach.  This minimizes the number of changes needed and reduces the risk of errors.



function_call:

initialize_output_from_input


result:

initialize_output_from_input()
