Here's an analysis of example_3, building upon the observations from previous examples:

**Example 3:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (73)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   6: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (2, 2)
    *   A single magenta (6) pixel at (5, 6)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (7, 3)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (65)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   6: (1)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (2, 2)
    *   A single magenta (6) pixel at (5, 6)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (7, 3)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels forming a cross around the red (2) pixel.
    *   Four orange (7) pixels forming a cross around the blue (1) pixel.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around existing red and blue pixels, respectively.


**Transformation:**

The transformation is consistent with the previous examples.  The rule remains:

*   For each blue (1) pixel, add an orange (7) cross pattern around it.
*   For each red (2) pixel, add a yellow (4) cross pattern around it.
*   Other colors (magenta (6) in this case) remain unchanged.


**Refinement of Hypothesis:**

Example 3 further solidifies the hypothesis that the transformation involves adding color-specific cross patterns around certain pixels (red and blue).  Magenta is currently not part of this.  More examples are needed to confirm whether this is a complete set of rules or whether other colors exist with their own patterns. We should also investigate whether the patterns change based on the surrounding pixels or have further conditions.
