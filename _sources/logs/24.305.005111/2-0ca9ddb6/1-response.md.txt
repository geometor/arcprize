Here's an analysis of example_1, focusing on identifying the transformation rules:

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (73)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (61)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels forming a cross around the red (2) pixel
    *   Four orange (7) pixels forming a square around the blue (1) pixel


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels; original pixels remain.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding new colored pixels around existing pixels.  Specifically:

*   A single red (2) pixel triggers the creation of a yellow (4) cross pattern around it. The pattern is centered at the original red pixel.
*   A single blue (1) pixel triggers the creation of an orange (7) square pattern around it. The pattern is centered at the original blue pixel.

**Hypothesis:**

The rule seems to be context-dependent, applying different patterns based on the color of the existing pixel. More examples are needed to verify this hypothesis and to check if there are other colors and pattern types.  The position of the new pixels relative to the existing pixel is also important in defining the specific pattern.
