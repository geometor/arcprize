1. Brief Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This paper presents H-ARC, a dataset containing human performance data on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark.  The study aimed to provide a robust estimate of human performance on ARC by evaluating 1729 humans on the full set of 800 tasks (400 training and 400 evaluation). The results show that human performance significantly exceeds current state-of-the-art AI approaches, with humans achieving 76.2% accuracy on the training set and 64.2% on the evaluation set.  The dataset is publicly released to facilitate further research.
