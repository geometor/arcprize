1. Brief Overview

This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) dataset.  The existing methods for evaluating LLM inference abilities are criticized as being results-centric, hindering a proper understanding of the inference process.  The authors propose a process-centric approach leveraging the ARC dataset to evaluate LLMs' inference and contextual understanding. The study focuses on three key aspects of human reasoning, as defined by the Language of Thought Hypothesis (LoTH): logical coherence, compositionality, and productivity.  The experiments reveal that while LLMs demonstrate some capabilities, they significantly lag behind humans in all three aspects, highlighting the need for further development.

 

2. Key Points

*   Existing LLM evaluation methods are primarily results-centric, neglecting the process.
*   The study uses the ARC dataset for a process-centric evaluation of LLM reasoning abilities.
*   Three aspects of human reasoning (LoTH) are investigated: logical coherence, compositionality, and productivity.
*   Experiments show LLMs have weak inference abilities and lag significantly behind humans in logical coherence, compositionality, and productivity.
*   The study proposes development paths for achieving human-level reasoning in LLMs.
*   ARC's limitations are discussed, and alternative benchmarks and evaluation methods are suggested.
