abstract
--------
The promise of human behavioral simulation--general-purpose computational
agents that replicate human behavior across domains--could enable broad
applications in policymaking and social science. We present a novel agent
architecture that simulates the attitudes and behaviors of 1,052 real
individuals--applying large language models to qualitative interviews about
their lives, then measuring how well these agents replicate the attitudes and
behaviors of the individuals that they represent. The generative agents
replicate participants' responses on the General Social Survey 85% as
accurately as participants replicate their own answers two weeks later, and
perform comparably in predicting personality traits and outcomes in
experimental replications. Our architecture reduces accuracy biases across
racial and ideological groups compared to agents given demographic
descriptions. This work provides a foundation for new tools that can help
investigate individual and collective behavior.
