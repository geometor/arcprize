abstract
--------
We introduce a novel approach to program synthesis that decomposes complex
functional tasks into simpler relational synthesis sub-tasks. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach using an off-the-shelf inductive logic
programming (ILP) system on three challenging datasets. Our results show that
(i) a relational representation can outperform a functional one, and (ii) an
off-the-shelf ILP system with a relational encoding can outperform
domain-specific approaches.
