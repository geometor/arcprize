summary
-------

Automated Design of Agentic Systems (ADAS) is a new research area that aims to automatically design powerful agentic systems.  The paper introduces Meta Agent Search, an algorithm that uses a meta-agent to iteratively program new agents in code, leveraging an ever-growing archive of previous discoveries. Experiments show that agents generated by Meta Agent Search consistently outperform state-of-the-art hand-designed agents across various domains and demonstrate robustness when transferred across domains and foundation models.  The work highlights the potential of ADAS as a faster and more efficient path to developing powerful agents.


Brief Overview
=============

This research paper introduces Automated Design of Agentic Systems (ADAS), a new research area focused on automatically generating powerful agentic systems.  The authors propose a novel algorithm called Meta Agent Search which leverages large language models (LLMs) as meta-agents to iteratively generate, test, and refine agents defined entirely in code.  Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate the superior performance and generalizability of the automatically generated agents compared to hand-designed baselines.  The study also emphasizes the importance of safe development in this new field.


Key Points
=========

* ADAS is formulated as a search problem with three key components: search space (code), search algorithm (Meta Agent Search), and evaluation function.
* Meta Agent Search uses LLMs as meta-agents to iteratively generate novel agents in code, evaluating them and adding them to an archive which informs future generations.
* Experiments across diverse domains (logic puzzles, reading comprehension, math, science) show significant performance improvements compared to hand-designed baselines.
* Automatically generated agents exhibit strong robustness and generalizability, maintaining superior performance even when transferred across different domains and foundation models.
* The research underscores the importance of developing ADAS safely, addressing the potential risks associated with untrusted model-generated code.
