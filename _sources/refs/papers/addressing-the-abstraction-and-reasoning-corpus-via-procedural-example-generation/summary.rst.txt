summary
-------

1. Brief Overview

This paper presents code that procedurally generates examples for the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) training tasks.  The code reverse engineers the underlying distribution of examples for each task, aiming to create a larger and more diverse set of examples than originally provided.  This expanded dataset enables a wider range of experiments, particularly focusing on sample-efficient learning.

2. Key Points

*   Procedurally generates examples for all 400 ARC tasks.
*   Reverse engineers the underlying distribution of examples for each task.
*   Aims for a larger and more diverse set of examples than the original ARC dataset.
*   Provides verifiers for each task to ensure the quality of generated examples.
*   Allows control over example difficulty through parameters.
*   Offers two metrics (RNG-Difficulty and PSO-Difficulty) for assessing example difficulty, but suggests post-hoc filtering for more robust control.
*   Highlights limitations, including the challenge of perfectly defining the underlying transformation logic for each task.
