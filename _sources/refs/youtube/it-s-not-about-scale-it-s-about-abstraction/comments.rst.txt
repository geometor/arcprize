  "I believe generalization has to do with scale of information, the ability to zoom in or out on the details of something (like the ability to compress data or \"expand' data while maintaining a span of the vector average). It's essentially an isomorphism between the high-volume simple data vs the low-volume rich info. So it seems reasonable that stats is the tool to be able to accurately reason inductively. But there's a bias because as humans we deem some things as true while others false. So we could imagine an ontology of the universe -- a topology / graph structure of the relationships of facts where a open set / line represents a truth in human perspective.",

  "LLMs are not at all related to intelligence. they have zero intellgence capability. All that they are are humongous mapping machines that have mapped different queries to different excerpts from the dataset. The only minimal sign of intelligence they show is combinng of the data in their dataset and  phrasing it. whih again, the phrasing itself is just because it has the dataset to map which words to use to desribke the required data to be displayed to user. sort of like  searching the dataset to first look  the solution template and then again look at the prevous data for how to phrase the solution to the user.",

  "Not sure why people keep pushing this AGI idea so much when its clear even regular narrow AI progress has stalled. No, its not about just increasing the scale of computation. A completely different, non-LLM approach is needed to get to AGI. Let me give you an example of why there will be no AGI any time soon.\n\nLLMs have a problem of information. We can calculate that 2+2=4 manually. We can say that we got that information from our teacher who taught us how to add numbers. If we use the calculator, the calculator got that information from an engineer who programmed it to add numbers. In both cases the information is being transferred from one place to another. From a  person to another person, or from a person to a machine. How is then an LLM-based AGI supposed to solve problems we can't solve yet, if the researchers need to train it upfront? The researchers need to know the solution to the problem upfront in order to train the system. Clearly then, the LLM-based approach leads us to a failure by default.\n\nNarrow AI is undoubtedly useful, but in order to reach AGI, we can't use the LLM-based approach at all. An AGI system needs to be able to solve problems on its own and learn on its own in order to help us solve problems we yet aren't able to solve. An LLM-based AI system on the other hand, is completely useless if it is not trained upfront for the specific task we want it to solve. It should then be clear that an LLM-based AGI system by definition can't help us solve problems we don't know how to solve yet, if we first have to train it to solve the problem. This is the Catch 22 problem of modern AI and I've been writing on this lately, but the amount of disinformation is staggering in this industry.",

  "The process of training an LLM *is* program search. Training is the process of using gradient descent to search for programs that produce the desired output. The benefit of neural networks over traditional program search is that it allows fuzzy matching, where small differences won't break the output entirely and instead only slightly deviate from the desired output so you can use gradient descent more effectively to find the right program.",

  "When critics argue that Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot truly reason or plan, they may be setting an unrealistic standard. Here's why:\n\nMost human work relies on pattern recognition and applying learned solutions to familiar problems. Only a small percentage of tasks require genuinely novel problem-solving. Even in academia, most research builds incrementally on existing work rather than making completely original breakthroughs.\n\nTherefore, even if LLMs operate purely through pattern matching without \"true\" reasoning, they can still revolutionize productivity by effectively handling the majority of pattern-based tasks that make up most human work. Just as we don't expect every researcher to produce completely original theories, it seems unreasonable to demand that LLMs demonstrate pure, original reasoning for them to be valuable tools.\n\nThe key insight is that being excellent at pattern recognition and knowledge application \u2013 even without deep understanding \u2013 can still transform how we work and solve problems. We should evaluate LLMs based on their practical utility rather than holding them to an idealized standard of human-like reasoning that even most humans don't regularly achieve",

It isn't about replacing LLMs, but that they are a component in a system for the goal of getting to AGI.  I don't think anybody could argue that LLMs are not valuable tools, even as they stand currently. But they may not be the best or most efficient tool for the job in any situation.

  "I don't get it, who has he been interacting with? The expert consensus was that we'd achieve AGI by the end of the decade (according to prediction markets), the timeline has been shrinking so it's well possible that it's achieved before but achieving it by 2024 was a niche, not mainstream",

  "For multiplications, I think it's because the LLM encounters in its dataset many occurrences of multiplications where the result appears without justification (42*17=714 for example). So it tries to immitate this by trying to \u201cintuit\u201d the solution. \nIf, instead, it were systematically shown the (human) method used to get the final result (I decompose 42 into its decimal form forty plus two, and 17 into its decimal form ten plus seven, then multiply the units using a table, the table tells me that the result is fourteen, etc.), I'm pretty sure that LLMs would do just fine. \nIt's easier said than done, of course, and it doesn't solve the more general problem from which this one derives (how to tell the LLM that certain bits of reasoning are skipped when presenting a result, because the use of a known, deterministic method is implicitly assumed, whether in mathematics or in discussions about any subject).",

With respect to the idea of combining solid reasoning competency within one or more reasoning subtypes in addition perhaps with other relevant facets of reasoning (i.e. learned through experience, particularly under uncertainty) to guide the search during inference, I believe this is a reasonable take on developing a more generalized set of abilities for a given AI agent.",

Leur \u00e9volution remonte \u00e0 des milliards d'ann\u00e9es, avec des origines que l'on peut retracer jusqu'aux premi\u00e8res formes de vie marine. Ces organismes ont \u00e9volu\u00e9 dans des environnements aquatiques o\u00f9 les mouvements rythmiques des vagues et des mutations al\u00e9atoires ont fa\u00e7onn\u00e9 leur d\u00e9veloppement. L'hypoth\u00e8se avanc\u00e9e ici est que l'impr\u00e9gnation chronologique, ou la capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9dire les rythmes environnementaux, a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le crucial dans cette \u00e9volution, permettant au syst\u00e8me nerveux de passer d'un \u00e9tat r\u00e9actif \u00e0 un \u00e9tat pr\u00e9dictif. Cette transition vers la pr\u00e9diction des r\u00e9gularit\u00e9s rythmiques de l'univers a jet\u00e9 les bases de ce que nous appelons aujourd'hui la logique.\r\n\u00c9volution des \u00catres Vivants dans l'Eau\r\nOrigines de la Vie Marine\r\nLes premi\u00e8res formes de vie sont apparues dans les oc\u00e9ans il y a environ 3,5 milliards d'ann\u00e9es. Ces premiers organismes unicellulaires ont \u00e9volu\u00e9 dans un environnement aquatique dynamique, soumis aux forces des mar\u00e9es et des courants. Les conditions changeantes de l'eau ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 un milieu o\u00f9 l'adaptation et la pr\u00e9diction des mouvements \u00e9taient essentielles \u00e0 la survie.\r\nAdaptations et Mutations\r\nDes mutations al\u00e9atoires ont conduit \u00e0 une diversification des formes de vie marine, favorisant celles capables de mieux naviguer dans leur environnement. Par exemple, les premiers poissons ont d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 des structures corporelles sophistiqu\u00e9es et des syst\u00e8mes sensoriels pour d\u00e9tecter et r\u00e9pondre aux mouvements de l'eau. Ces adaptations ont permis un meilleur contr\u00f4le de la nage et des r\u00e9ponses plus efficaces face aux pr\u00e9dateurs et aux proies.\r\nImportance des Mouvements de l'Eau\r\nLes vagues et les courants ont jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le crucial en fournissant des stimuli rythmiques constants. Les organismes marins capables d'anticiper ces mouvements avaient un avantage \u00e9volutif significatif. Ils pouvaient non seulement r\u00e9agir, mais aussi pr\u00e9dire les variations environnementales, assurant une meilleure stabilit\u00e9 et efficacit\u00e9 dans leurs d\u00e9placements.\r\nImpr\u00e9gnation Chronologique et Syst\u00e8me Nerveux\r\nConcept de l'Impr\u00e9gnation Chronologique\r\nL'impr\u00e9gnation chronologique fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 des syst\u00e8mes nerveux \u00e0 enregistrer et utiliser des informations temporelles pour pr\u00e9dire des \u00e9v\u00e9nements futurs. Cela signifie que les premiers syst\u00e8mes nerveux n'\u00e9taient pas seulement r\u00e9actifs, mais aussi capables d'anticiper les changements rythmiques de leur environnement\u2014des changements qui s'alignaient sur la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 rythmique et silencieuse de l'univers.\r\nAvantages Adaptatifs\r\nPour les organismes marins primitifs, cette capacit\u00e9 pr\u00e9dictive offrait des avantages adaptatifs majeurs. Par exemple, la capacit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9dire une grosse vague permettait \u00e0 un organisme de se stabiliser ou de se d\u00e9placer strat\u00e9giquement pour \u00e9viter la turbulence, augmentant ainsi ses chances de survie et de reproduction.\r\nTransition de la R\u00e9activit\u00e9 \u00e0 la Pr\u00e9diction\r\nAu fil du temps, les syst\u00e8mes nerveux ont \u00e9volu\u00e9 pour int\u00e9grer de plus en plus cette capacit\u00e9 pr\u00e9dictive. Cela a conduit \u00e0 des structures c\u00e9r\u00e9brales plus complexes, comme le cervelet chez les poissons, impliqu\u00e9 dans la coordination motrice et la pr\u00e9diction des mouvements. Ce passage de la simple r\u00e9activit\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9diction a pos\u00e9 les bases d'une logique primitive.\r\nLa Logique comme Capacit\u00e9 Pr\u00e9dictive\r\nD\u00e9finition de la Logique\r\nDans ce contexte, la logique primitive peut \u00eatre d\u00e9finie comme la capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 utiliser des informations sur les r\u00e9gularit\u00e9s et les rythmes environnementaux pour faire des pr\u00e9dictions pr\u00e9cises. Il s'agit d'une forme avanc\u00e9e de traitement de l'information qui va au-del\u00e0 de la simple r\u00e9action aux stimuli.\r\nRythme et R\u00e9gularit\u00e9s\r\nLes environnements aquatiques fournissaient des rythmes et des r\u00e9gularit\u00e9s constants, tels que les cycles des mar\u00e9es et des courants oc\u00e9aniques. Les organismes capables de d\u00e9tecter et de comprendre ces rythmes pouvaient pr\u00e9dire les changements, ce qui constituait une forme primitive de logique. La r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 silencieuse de ces rythmes a impr\u00e9gn\u00e9 leur d\u00e9veloppement, les poussant \u00e0 anticiper plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 r\u00e9agir.\r\nApplication aux Premiers \u00catres Marins\r\nPrenons l'exemple des poissons primitifs. Leur capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 anticiper les mouvements de l'eau et \u00e0 ajuster leur nage en cons\u00e9quence est une d\u00e9monstration claire de cette logique pr\u00e9dictive. Ils pouvaient d\u00e9terminer si une vague serait grande ou petite, leur permettant ainsi de naviguer efficacement dans leur environnement.\r\nR\u00e9sonance avec les Id\u00e9es de David Hume\r\nBr\u00e8ve Introduction \u00e0 Hume\r\nDavid Hume, philosophe \u00e9cossais du XVIIIe si\u00e8cle, est c\u00e9l\u00e8bre pour son scepticisme et ses id\u00e9es sur la causalit\u00e9. Il a soutenu que notre compr\u00e9hension des relations de cause \u00e0 effet repose sur l'habitude et l'exp\u00e9rience plut\u00f4t que sur un savoir inn\u00e9 ou logique.\r\nHume est surtout connu pour sa critique de la causalit\u00e9, sugg\u00e9rant que notre croyance en des liens causals est issue d'une habitude psychologique form\u00e9e \u00e0 travers des exp\u00e9riences r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es, et non d'une justification rationnelle. Ce point de vue a profond\u00e9ment influenc\u00e9 la philosophie, la science, et l'\u00e9pist\u00e9mologie.\r\nParall\u00e8les avec Cette Hypoth\u00e8se\r\nLes id\u00e9es de Hume r\u00e9sonnent avec cette hypoth\u00e8se sur l'\u00e9volution de la logique. Tout comme Hume sugg\u00e9rait que notre compr\u00e9hension de la causalit\u00e9 vient de l'observation de r\u00e9gularit\u00e9s, cette hypoth\u00e8se propose que la logique primitive des premiers organismes marins a \u00e9merg\u00e9 de leur capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9dire les rythmes et r\u00e9gularit\u00e9s de leur environnement. Les organismes marins, tout comme les humains qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 analys\u00e9s par Hume, ont \u00e9volu\u00e9 pour anticiper, non pas gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une logique inn\u00e9e, mais par l'exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e de ces rythmes naturels.\r\nConclusion\r\nL'\u00e9volution de la conscience, de l'intelligence et de la logique est intimement li\u00e9e \u00e0 l'histoire des premi\u00e8res formes de vie marine et \u00e0 leur adaptation \u00e0 un environnement rythm\u00e9 par les mouvements de l'eau. L'impr\u00e9gnation chronologique a permis \u00e0 ces organismes de d\u00e9velopper des capacit\u00e9s pr\u00e9dictives, posant les fondations de ce que nous appelons aujourd'hui la logique. Les id\u00e9es de David Hume sur la causalit\u00e9 et l'habitude renforcent cette perspective, en soulignant l'importance de l'exp\u00e9rience et de l'habitude dans le d\u00e9veloppement de la pens\u00e9e causale. Comprendre cette \u00e9volution offre une nouvelle perspective sur la nature de la logique et son r\u00f4le fondamental dans l'intelligence humaine.",

  "    - General Impression of this Lecture (some rant here, so bear with me): \nI like Chollet's way of thinking about these things, despite some disagreements I have. The presentation was well executed and all of his thoughts very digestible. He is quite a bit different in thought from many of the 'AI tycoons', which I appreciate. His healthy skepticism within the current context of AI is admirable. \n\nOn the other side of the balance, I think his rough thesis that we *need* to build 'the Rennaissance AI'  is philosophically debatable. I also think the ethics surrounding his emphasis that generalization is imperative to examine more deeply.  For example: Why DO we NEED agents that are the 'Rennaissance human'? If this is our true end game in all of this, then we're simply doing this work to build something human-like, if not a more efficient, effective version of our generalized selves. What kind of creation is that really? Why do this work vs build more specialized agents, some of which naturally may require more 'generalized' intelligence of a human (I'm musing  robotic assistants as an example), but that are more specific to domains and work alongside humans as an augment to help better HUMANS (not overpaid CEOs, not the AIs, not the cult of singularity acolytes, PEOPLE). This is what I believe the promise of AI should be (and is also how my company develops in this space).   Settle down from the hyper-speed-culture-I-cant-think-for-myself-and-must-have-everything-RIGHT-NOW-on-my-rectangle-of-knowledge cult of ideas  - t.e. 'we need something that can do anything for me, and do it immediately'. Why not let the human mind evolve, even in a way that can be augmented by a responsibly and meticulously developed AI agent?\n\nA Sidestep - the meaning of Intelligence and 'WTF is IQ REALLY?':\nAs an aside, and just for definition's sake - the words 'Artificial Intelligence' can connote many ideas, but even the term 'intelligence' is not entirely clear. And having a single word 'intelligence' that we infer what it is our minds do and how they process, might even be antiquated itself. As we've moved forward in the years of understanding the abstraction - the emerging property of computation with in the brain - that we call 'intelligence', the word has become to edge towards a definite plural. I mean ok, everyone likes the idea of our own cognitive benchmark, the 'god-only-knows-one-number-you-need-to-know-for-your-name-tag', being reduced to a simple positive integer. \n\nNaturally the IQ test itself has been questioned in what it measures (you can see this particularly in apps and platforms that give a person IQ test style questions, claiming that this will make you a 20x human in all things cognitive. It has also been shown that these cognitive puzzle type platforms don't have any demonstrable effect on improvements in practical human applications that an IQ test would suggest one should be smart enough to deal with.  The platforms themselves (some of whose subscription prices are shocking) appear in the literature to be far more limited to helping the user become better at solving the types of problems they themselves produce. In this sort of 'reversing the interpretation' of intelligence, I would argue that  the paradigmatic thought on multiple intelligences would arguably make more sense given the different domains humans vary in ability. \n\nAI = Rennaissance Intellect or Specialist?\nWhile I agree that, for any one intelligence, a definition that includes 'how well once adapts to dealling with something novel' engages a more foundational reasoning component of human cognition. But it still sits within the domain of that area of reasoning and any subsequent problem solving or decisions/inferences. Further, most of the literature appears to agree that, beyond reasoning, that 'intelligence' would also mean being able to deal with weak priors (we might think of this something akin to 'intuition', but that's also  a loaded topic).

This requires a deeper exploration of the abstractions that generate the emergent property of some type of intelligence abstraction. \n\nSure, there are adjacent and tangential intelligences that complement each other well and can be used to build AI agents that become great at human assistance  - but, wait a minute, do we know which humans we're talking about benefitting? people-at-large? corporate execs? the wealthy?  who?.

  "At around 14:00 we get to the usual semantic problem of the whole word AI, Artificial Intelligence. The Minsky vs McCarthy, and Darwin vs Locke distinction is meaningful and a lot of confusion comes from this. The main source of that confusion might be that in cognitive sciences and especially emobodied cognition models that seem to be the most useful for AI folks, there is actually three distinct concepts: intelligence, reasoning and wisdom.\n\nThe Minsky and Darwin approaches are actually perfectly aligned with what we consider as intelligence: it is about patter matching and describe the kind of activity humans do when we are simulating solutions in a flow states. The result of flow state is often an experiment, for example when programmer runs the program against some kind of test. If the test succeeds, the flow continues. If test doesn't succeed, we need to step back and start reasoning. In practice intelligence in flow state operates using and extending same logical circuit, while reasoning is about debugging the logical circuit or in worst case scenario, replacing the original idea with new logical circuit.\n\nWisdom on the other hand encodes the pragmatic common interactions with some empirical problems to a logic circuit of it's own for other human beings to use. We could use the concept of psychotechnology to describe the scientific development of tools that fit human mind and enable us to model the world so that usage of more physical tools (that fit the hand) will succeed. Intelligence is an algorithm that describes how physical tool is used, reasoning is about debugging that algorithm, while wisdom creates a wider program that describes a system of empirical problems where using a specific physical tool is sensible. In other words, wisdom produces a logic circuit of constraints, because intelligence alone is vulnerable to ad hoc fixes ad infinitum; recursive fine-tuning of same logic circuit with same tool to same problem is not guaranteed to solve the problem, if the system is dynamic and the state change of the problem is constantly keeping us out of distribution where success is possible.\n\nI think perhaps a best way forward would be to accept that we might have AI, because the LLMs are kind of doing that: blindly staying in the flow state even when the process is not moving forward. We could coin new concepts like AR and AW: Artificial Reasoning and Artificial Wisdom. I have done some experiments with Artificial Reasoning when I have been building language models for understanding natural narrative structures instead of natural language structures. Natural narrative is the encoded manuscript, from which in some state of mind a proficient author of fiction would decode it to specific subset of possible language representations, but another author or same author in some other state of mind would do it differently. When AI runs with zero temperament it always decodes the same manuscript similarly; adding random noise with temperance doesn't actually change the semantic context it is in, but rather allows the model to use multiple paths (logic circuits) within same context. This is not reasoning, because the root of the logic circuit is not changed, it is still same psychotechnology with same parameters, which is just adding permutations to the same ingredients of the word soup.\n\nThe funny thing with human authors is that we are transcendental and transgressive problem solvers. When we decode a manuscript we might leave out something or add something from ourselves, from out existential growing (the stuff we fill the tabula rasa with; though I am not a fan of Locke, but the existential point is acceptable). While we don't strictly follow manuscripts, for some reason we are often robust and anti-fragile in our transcendental and transgressive reshaping of reality, which to me sounds like creativity. Creativity is kind of Oracle Machine to translation, where the unwarranted permutations of original message might actually be useful, because evolutionarily the domain of human ideas is always within the distribution of human beings, because the psychotechnology for the analogs exists in our brain in Chomskyan manner. In history of philosophy, many fruitful ideas of new authors have originated from bad translations of the older authors, or purposeful transgression or transcendence of their original ideas. It is not an incidence that the dialogue between British Empiricism and German Idealism was fruitful in the era of Enlightenment. This is how we operate.\n\nWhen Quine defends the Peircian idea of discursive intentionality to Carnap, he makes an interesting post-Kantian maneuver. Kant is fundamentally bound to the Cartesian mind-set, which assumes that science is based on necessary modality instead of sufficient modality. The consequence of this is that his mindset is unable to understand the generativeness of concepts from interactive abstraction by humans. Hegel instead suggests that dialectic meaning negotiations of subjective perspectives creates new concepts. LLm's are not flexible in their thinking, because they assume necessary modality between the word distributions of prompts and utterings.\n\nIntelligence in classical computers follows first-order logic necessarily, because the outcome of the work of Boole, Frege and Russel was that computational logic based on digital information (developed originally by Descartes, Hobbes, Leibniz and Ramon Lull) can not understand logic that is not devoid of semantics. Thus syntactic coherence is where we are strongly bounded by using computers as technology to support our psychotechnological processes. Because of the scalability of digital electronic computers, we can simulate higher-order logic, but we are not given any guarantees of time and space complexities of the logic circuits such simulators give. We can express quantum logical simulations with classical computers, but when the simulation meets the halting-problem, we might be using quantum logic for the correct problem, where quantum advantage might exist Because quantum logic is dynamical and conditional, it might give some rise for Artificial Reasoning capabilities.\n\nBy introducing the concepts of AR and AW to the AI discussions, the semantic decoherencies in the usage of the word Intelligence, would become more transparent.",
